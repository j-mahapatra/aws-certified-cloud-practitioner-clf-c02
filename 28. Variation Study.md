# AWS Config vs AWS AppConfig

Although they share part of the name, **AWS Config** and **AWS AppConfig** are two distinct services with different goals and use cases.

## AWS Config

### What Is It?

**AWS Config** is a **configuration monitoring and compliance auditing service**. It helps you **track changes to AWS resources**, **record configuration history**, and **evaluate compliance** against desired settings.

### Key Features:

- Tracks resource **config changes** across AWS (e.g., EC2, IAM, S3)
- **Records snapshots** of configurations and relationships over time
- Automatically checks for **compliance violations** (e.g., unencrypted volumes)
- Supports **custom and managed rules** for compliance
- Fully integrated with **AWS Organizations** for multi-account setups

### Use Cases:

- Auditing and compliance (e.g., SOC 2, PCI DSS)
- Security posture management
- Troubleshooting configuration-related issues
- Detecting drift in infrastructure

### Example:

If a security group is changed to allow 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22, AWS Config logs the change and can mark it **non-compliant** based on your rule.

## AWS AppConfig

### What Is It?

**AWS AppConfig** is a capability of **AWS Systems Manager** that lets you **deploy application configuration changes** in a **controlled, validated, and gradual way**, without having to redeploy code.

### Key Features:

- **Separate config from code** (e.g., feature flags, environment variables)
- Supports **canary, linear, and all-at-once deployments**
- Validates config before deployment using **JSON schema or Lambda**
- Enables **rollbacks** if config causes problems
- Integrated with **CloudWatch, SNS, and EventBridge** for alerts

### Use Cases:

- Feature flag toggles (e.g., enable dark mode for 10% of users)
- Updating dynamic values like service endpoints or timeouts
- Controlling app behavior without code deployments
- Multi-environment configuration management (dev/staging/prod)

### Example:

You can deploy a new configuration that enables a feature flag in **5% increments every 10 minutes**, and roll back automatically if errors spike.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature             | **AWS Config**                                 | **AWS AppConfig**                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose             | Track AWS resource configurations & compliance | Deploy dynamic app configs safely          |
| Resource Scope      | AWS infrastructure                             | Application runtime behavior               |
| Monitors            | EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, etc.                        | Feature flags, URLs, environment variables |
| Used By             | Security, Compliance, DevOps                   | Developers, DevOps, Product teams          |
| Compliance Focus    | Yes                                            | No                                         |
| Rollback Support    | No                                             | Yes                                        |
| Deployment Strategy | N/A                                            | Canary, Linear, All-at-once                |

## Summary

- Use **AWS Config** when you want to **track and audit AWS resource configurations**, ensure compliance, and detect drift.
- Use **AWS AppConfig** when you want to **manage and deploy application-level configurations** (e.g., feature flags) **safely and gradually**, without redeploying code.

# Amazon SNS vs Amazon SQS

Amazon **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** and **SQS (Simple Queue Service)** are both **messaging services**, but they serve **different purposes** and follow **different communication patterns**.

## Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)

A **pub/sub (publish-subscribe)** messaging service that **sends messages to multiple subscribers** instantly.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Push-based** messaging
- One message → **multiple recipients**
- Supports multiple protocols: HTTP/S, Email, SMS, Lambda, SQS
- Near real-time delivery

### Use Cases:

- Send alerts via Email/SMS
- Fan-out architecture (1-to-many delivery)
- Trigger Lambda functions
- Notify multiple systems of the same event

### Example:

An SNS topic for **order events** notifies:

- Email recipient
- An SQS queue for billing
- A Lambda for analytics

## Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)

A **fully managed message queue** for **decoupling systems** and handling asynchronous workloads.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Pull-based** messaging
- One message → **one consumer**
- Messages are stored until **polled and processed**
- Supports **message visibility timeout**, **dead-letter queues**

### Use Cases:

- Decouple microservices or components
- Buffer jobs (e.g., image processing, emails)
- Smooth out traffic bursts
- Retry failed tasks

### Example:

A **web app** places a message in an SQS queue when a user uploads a photo. A **background worker** later picks it up to process and store the image.

## SNS vs SQS: Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature                 | **Amazon SNS**                       | **Amazon SQS**                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Communication Pattern   | Pub/Sub (fan-out)                    | Point-to-point (queue-based)               |
| Delivery Mode           | Push                                 | Pull                                       |
| Subscribers             | Multiple                             | One consumer per message                   |
| Message Storage         | No (unless delivery fails)           | Yes, persists until processed or expires   |
| Message Retention       | No (transient)                       | Up to 14 days                              |
| Delivery Protocols      | HTTP, HTTPS, Email, SMS, Lambda, SQS | SQS API only                               |
| Use Case Examples       | Alerts, fan-out to systems           | Background tasks, decoupling microservices |
| Ordering Support        | No                                   | FIFO Queues available                      |
| Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) | For failed deliveries (SQS/Lambda)   | For processing failures                    |

## Combining SNS and SQS

For fan-out with guaranteed delivery:

1. **Publish to an SNS topic**
2. **Subscribe multiple SQS queues**
3. Each queue gets a copy of the message — processed independently

This pattern is **highly reliable**, scalable, and loosely coupled.

## Summary

| Choose When You Need...           | Use This Service |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| One message → many recipients     | SNS              |
| Queueing with guaranteed delivery | SQS              |
| Decoupled microservices           | SQS              |
| Real-time alerting                | SNS              |
| Message persistence               | SQS              |
| Message broadcast with retries    | SNS + SQS        |

# AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Variants

**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets—such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, or Lambda functions—in one or more Availability Zones. It improves fault tolerance and scalability for applications.

AWS offers **three main types** (variants) of load balancers under the ELB umbrella, each suited to specific use cases:

## 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

### Purpose:

Best suited for **HTTP and HTTPS traffic** at the **application layer (Layer 7)**.

### Key Features:

- Content-based routing (host-based, path-based, query string)
- Supports **WebSocket** and **HTTP/2**
- Native support for **containerized applications (ECS/EKS)**
- Can route requests to **multiple services (microservices)** behind a single load balancer
- Supports authentication via **Cognito or OIDC**

### Use Cases:

- Microservices architecture
- RESTful APIs
- Web applications with dynamic routing (e.g., `/users` vs `/orders`)
- Applications requiring SSL termination and user authentication

## 2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)

### Purpose:

Designed for **high performance, low-latency TCP/UDP traffic** at the **transport layer (Layer 4)**.

### Key Features:

- Handles **millions of requests per second** with ultra-low latency
- Supports **static IP addresses** and **Elastic IPs**
- TLS (SSL) termination support
- Preserves **source IP address** (useful for security logging)
- Ideal for load balancing across **on-prem and AWS hybrid environments**

### Use Cases:

- Real-time applications (gaming, financial services)
- Load balancing **non-HTTP** services (e.g., SMTP, FTP, DNS)
- High-throughput or latency-sensitive applications

## 3. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

### Purpose:

Used to deploy, scale, and manage **third-party virtual appliances** (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems) transparently.

### Key Features:

- Operates at **Layer 3 (network layer)**
- Combines **transparent network gateway** and **load balancing**
- Simplifies deployment of **security and network appliances**
- Integrates with **VPC Traffic Mirroring**
- Routes traffic to appliances via **GENEVE protocol**

### Use Cases:

- Inserting **security appliances** into traffic flows
- Centralized inspection for traffic entering or leaving VPCs
- Scalable deployment of **firewalls, IDS, IPS**

| Best For               | Web apps, APIs, microservices | Real-time and hybrid apps | Network and security appliances |

## Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

**Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** is the **original generation** of AWS load balancers that supports both **Layer 4 (TCP)** and **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)** traffic. It provides basic load balancing across EC2 instances and has been widely used for legacy applications. However, it **lacks advanced features** such as content-based routing, WebSocket support, and container integration. AWS has officially **deprecated CLB for new applications**, and it is **strongly recommended** to migrate workloads to **ALB or NLB**, which offer better performance, security, and flexibility.

## Summary

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Best for web apps and HTTP APIs with advanced routing.
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Ideal for high-performance TCP/UDP traffic with static IPs.
- **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**: Purpose-built for transparent insertion of virtual appliances.
