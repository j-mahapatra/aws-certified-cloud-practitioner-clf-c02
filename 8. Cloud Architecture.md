# High Availability

- High Availability (HA) refers to the design and implementation of systems that are continuously operational, with minimal downtime, even in the face of hardware failures, software issues, or network disruptions.

- The goal of high availability is to ensure that critical services remain accessible at all times. This is typically achieved by:

  - Eliminating single points of failure

  - Adding redundancy across components (servers, storage, network)

  - Automating failover mechanisms

  - Monitoring and healing failures quickly

# High Scalability

- High scalability refers to a system's ability to handle increasing workloads efficiently by adding resources, either automatically or with minimal effort-without compromising performance or availability.

- A highly scalable system can grow (or shrink) in response to demand, whether it's more users, more data, or more transactions per second.

## Types of Scalability

| Type                               | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)**    | Add more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to an existing server                                 |
| **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)** | Add more servers or nodes to distribute load                                             |
| **Auto Scaling**                   | Dynamically add/remove resources based on demand (common in cloud environments like AWS) |

## How is it achieved?

AWS services are designed to scale easily:

- EC2 Auto Scaling Groups: Automatically increase/decrease EC2 instances

- Lambda: Automatically scales with the number of events

- S3: Infinitely scalable object storage

- DynamoDB: Scales read/write throughput automatically with demand

- Aurora Serverless: Auto-scales database capacity

# High Elasticity

- High elasticity is the ability of a system to automatically scale resources up or down based on real-time demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency without manual intervention.

- While scalability is about being able to grow, elasticity focuses on the speed and automation of that growth (and shrinkage).

## Characteristics

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automatic Scaling**      | Resources are added or removed dynamically based on metrics like CPU, memory, or traffic load |
| **Rapid Adjustment**       | Scaling happens in near real-time to match changing demand                                    |
| **Cost Optimization**      | Prevents over-provisioning and underutilization by scaling down unused resources              |
| **No Manual Intervention** | Elastic systems self-adjust without human input                                               |

## How is it achieved?

AWS services with built-in elasticity:

- EC2 Auto Scaling: Scales instance count based on load

- Lambda: Automatically runs and scales code in response to events

- ECS/Fargate: Scales containers based on usage

- DynamoDB On-Demand: Scales read/write throughput automatically

- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes traffic based on real-time load

# Fault Tolerance

- Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating properly even when one or more components fail. It ensures that a system remains functional, available, and resilient, even in the presence of hardware, software, or network failures.

- A fault-tolerant system doesn’t just detect and recover from failures—it is designed to withstand them without affecting the end user.

## Key Techniques

| Technique         | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Redundancy**    | Duplicate components (servers, disks, databases) to take over when one fails |
| **Failover**      | Automatic switchover to a backup system on failure                           |
| **Replication**   | Keeping copies of data/services in multiple locations                        |
| **Health Checks** | Regularly monitor components and detect failures early                       |
| **Isolation**     | Contain faults within one part of the system to prevent cascading failures   |

## How is it achieved?

AWS offers many tools to build fault-tolerant systems:

- Availability Zones (AZs): Run workloads across multiple AZs to tolerate AZ-level failures

- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Automatically reroutes traffic if an instance fails

- Auto Scaling Groups: Replace failed EC2 instances automatically

- Route 53: DNS failover to healthy endpoints

- Amazon S3/DynamoDB: Built with multi-AZ data redundancy

# High Durability

- High durability refers to the ability of a system or storage solution to reliably retain data over time without loss, even in the face of hardware failures, disasters, or other adverse events.

- A highly durable system ensures that once your data is written, it won’t be lost or corrupted—even after many years or unexpected failures. e.g. - Amazon S3 offers 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability, meaning if you store 10 million objects, you might lose one every 10,000 years.

## Key Techniques

| Technique                        | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Replication**             | Data is stored in multiple devices, often across Availability Zones or regions     |
| **Checksums & Integrity Checks** | Detect and fix data corruption through regular scanning and validation             |
| **Versioning**                   | Preserve older versions of data to recover from accidental deletions or overwrites |
| **Automated Backups**            | Maintain recoverable copies of data at different points in time                    |
| **Geo-Redundancy**               | Store data across geographically distant regions to survive regional disasters     |

## How is it achieved?

AWS services designed for extreme durability include:

- Amazon S3: 11 nines durability with automatic multi-AZ replication

- Amazon Glacier: Archival storage with very high durability for long-term data

- Amazon DynamoDB: Automatically replicates data across multiple AZs

- Amazon EBS Snapshots: Backup volumes with cross-AZ and cross-region support

# Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

- A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a strategic blueprint that outlines how an organization will continue operating during and after a disruption, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, pandemics, or system failures.

- To ensure that critical business functions continue with minimal downtime, data loss, or financial impact-even in the face of major disruptions. e.g. - In cloud terms, BCP includes things like data backups, failover systems, disaster recovery, and employee communication plans.

## Key Components of a BCP

| Component                          | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Risk Assessment**                | Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities (e.g., floods, ransomware, outages)               |
| **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** | Determine the effect of disruptions on business operations                                       |
| **Recovery Strategies**            | Define how to restore IT systems, data, and services (e.g., using backups, multi-AZ deployments) |
| **Communication Plan**             | Clear instructions for notifying employees, customers, and stakeholders                          |
| **Roles & Responsibilities**       | Assign staff to key recovery tasks and leadership during crises                                  |
| **Testing & Drills**               | Regularly simulate disruptions to ensure the plan works and people are trained                   |
| **Plan Maintenance**               | Keep the BCP updated as systems, teams, and risks evolve                                         |

## How is it achieved?

Cloud platforms offer tools that directly support BCP:

- Multi-AZ and Multi-Region deployments

- Data backup & restore (e.g., Amazon S3, EBS Snapshots)

- Disaster Recovery Services (e.g., AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery)

- Auto Scaling & Load Balancing

- Cloud-based communication & collaboration tools (e.g., Chime, WorkMail)

## Importance

- Ensures continuity of revenue and customer service

- Minimizes downtime and data loss

- Reduces legal and compliance risks

- Builds resilience and stakeholder trust

- RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) are two fundamental concepts in disaster recovery and business continuity planning. They define how much data you can afford to lose and how long you can afford to be down during a failure.
  - RPO (Recovery Point Objective): The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
  - RTO (Recovery Time Objective): The maximum acceptable downtime after a failure or disaster.

# Disaster Recovery Options

- Disaster Recovery (DR) in AWS refers to the strategies and services used to restore critical systems and data after a failure, disaster, or outage—ensuring business continuity.

- AWS provides flexible, cost-effective DR options based on recovery time (RTO) and recovery point (RPO) requirements.

## Four Disaster Recovery Strategies in AWS

| DR Strategy                  | RTO / RPO          | Cost    | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backup & Restore**         | High RTO / RPO     | Low     | Store data backups in S3, RDS, or EBS Snapshots. Recover manually. Simple and cost-effective.                   |
| **Pilot Light**              | Medium RTO / RPO   | Medium  | Core components (e.g., databases) are always running; other infrastructure is launched when needed.             |
| **Warm Standby**             | Low RTO / RPO      | Higher  | A scaled-down version of the full system is always running and ready to scale up quickly.                       |
| **Multi-Site / Hot Standby** | Very Low RTO / RPO | Highest | Fully redundant infrastructure in multiple AWS regions, running simultaneously and ready to failover instantly. |
