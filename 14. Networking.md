# AWS Cloud Network Architecture (Public Access Flow)

A typical AWS VPC network setup for public-facing resources follows this path:

## Architecture Flow (Inbound)

**Internet**  
↓  
**Internet Gateway (IGW)**  
↓  
**VPC Router**  
↓  
**Route Table** (with route to IGW)  
↓  
**Subnet**  
↓  
**Network ACL (NACL)** – Stateless layer of security  
↓  
**Security Group (SG)** – Stateful firewall for resources  
↓  
**EC2 Instance / Load Balancer / Other Resource**

## Component Breakdown

### 1. **Internet Gateway (IGW)**

- Enables communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.
- Must be attached to a VPC and referenced in a route table for outbound/inbound access.

### 2. **Router (Implicit)**

- Built-in component of the VPC.
- Uses route tables to determine how to direct traffic within and outside the VPC.

### 3. **Route Table**

- Contains rules (routes) to direct network traffic.
- Example: `0.0.0.0/0 → igw-xxxxxxxx` (sends all internet-bound traffic to the IGW).

### 4. **Subnet**

- Logical partition of the VPC IP address space.
- Public subnets have routes to the IGW; private subnets do not.

### 5. **Network ACL (NACL)**

- Acts as a stateless firewall at the subnet level.
- Evaluates **both inbound and outbound rules** for each packet.
- Rules are evaluated in order; must explicitly allow/deny traffic.

### 6. **Security Group**

- Acts as a **stateful firewall** attached to instances.
- Only evaluates **allowed inbound and outbound rules**.
- Return traffic is automatically allowed.

### 7. **EC2 Instance / Load Balancer**

- The actual compute or load balancing resource that handles the traffic.

## Example Public Access Flow

A user accesses a web server running on EC2 in a public subnet:

User → Internet → IGW → Router → Route Table (0.0.0.0/0 → IGW)
→ Public Subnet → NACL (allow 80/443) → Security Group (allow 80/443)
→ EC2 (Web Server)

## Notes

- Both **NACL and Security Groups** must allow traffic for it to be accepted.
- **NACLs are stateless**: you need to allow both inbound and outbound rules explicitly.
- **Security Groups are stateful**: response traffic is automatically allowed.

# What is Amazon VPC and Subnets?

## 1. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

**Amazon VPC** is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can **launch AWS resources in a virtual network** that you define. It gives you full control over networking, including IP addressing, routing, security, and internet connectivity.

### Key Features

- Define your own **IPv4/IPv6 CIDR block**
- Create **subnets** in specific **Availability Zones**
- Configure **route tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways**
- Use **security groups** and **network ACLs** for traffic control
- Connect to **on-premises networks** using VPN or Direct Connect

### Use Cases

- Hosting secure applications in a private environment
- Creating isolated environments for development, testing, and production
- Running multi-tier applications with segmented network layers

## 2. Subnets in VPC

A **subnet** is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. Subnets divide the VPC into smaller, manageable sections and are used to **deploy resources within specific Availability Zones**.

Each subnet must be associated with a **route table**, **NACL**, and is either **public** or **private**:

### Types of Subnets

| Subnet Type         | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Subnet**   | Has a route to the Internet Gateway; used for internet-facing resources (e.g., web servers) |
| **Private Subnet**  | No direct route to the Internet Gateway; used for internal resources (e.g., databases)      |
| **Isolated Subnet** | No outbound internet access; used for high-security workloads (e.g., backups)               |

### Subnet Rules

- A subnet belongs to **one Availability Zone**
- You define the subnet’s **CIDR block** (subset of VPC CIDR)
- Subnets must have **non-overlapping IP ranges**
- Each subnet uses **VPC-level components** like security groups and route tables

## VPC Components Overview

| Component              | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CIDR Block**         | IP address range of the VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)                         |
| **Subnet**             | Subdivision of VPC in an Availability Zone                              |
| **Internet Gateway**   | Allows resources in public subnets to access the internet               |
| **NAT Gateway**        | Enables private subnets to access the internet for outbound connections |
| **Route Table**        | Contains rules that determine where network traffic is directed         |
| **Security Group**     | Stateful firewall applied to instances                                  |
| **Network ACL (NACL)** | Stateless firewall at the subnet level                                  |

## Example Architecture

```
VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
│
├── Public Subnet (10.0.1.0/24) [with Internet Gateway]
│ └── EC2 Instance (Web Server)
│
├── Private Subnet (10.0.2.0/24) [with NAT Gateway]
│ └── EC2 Instance (App Server)
│
└── Isolated Subnet (10.0.3.0/24) [No Internet]
└── RDS Database Instance
```

## Summary

- **VPC** is your private network in AWS where you control IP ranges, subnets, routing, and security.
- **Subnets** divide your VPC into segments placed in Availability Zones.
- Use **public subnets** for internet-facing apps, **private subnets** for backend components, and **isolated subnets** for sensitive workloads.

Together, VPC and subnets are foundational for building secure and scalable cloud architectures.

# Security Groups vs Network ACLs (NACLs) in AWS

Both **Security Groups** and **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)** are used to control network traffic in AWS VPCs, but they operate at **different layers** and behave **differently**.

## 1. Security Groups

**Security Groups (SGs)** act as **virtual firewalls at the instance level**. They are **stateful**, meaning if you allow **inbound** traffic, the **response traffic is automatically allowed**.

### Key Characteristics

- Applied to **EC2 instances**, **Lambda**, **RDS**, **Elastic Load Balancers**, etc.
- **Stateful**: If you allow inbound traffic, the return traffic is automatically allowed, without having to specify outbound rules.
- Operate at the **instance level**
- Evaluate **only allowed traffic** (no deny rules)
- Can be assigned to **multiple instances**
- Supports **allow rules only**

### Example Use Case

Allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 22 (SSH) to a web server.

## 2. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

**NACLs** act as **stateless firewalls at the subnet level**. Both **inbound and outbound rules must be explicitly defined**, and they support **allow and deny** rules.

### Key Characteristics

- Applied to **subnets**
- **Stateless**: Responses to allowed inbound traffic must be explicitly allowed in outbound rules
- Operate at the **subnet level**
- Rules are evaluated in **numbered order (lowest first)**
- Supports both **allow and deny rules**
- Automatically associated with subnets; one NACL per subnet

### Example Use Case

Block traffic from a specific IP address or CIDR block at the subnet level.

## Comparison Table

| Feature               | Security Group                       | Network ACL (NACL)                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Layer                 | Instance level                       | Subnet level                             |
| Stateful/Stateless    | Stateful                             | Stateless                                |
| Rule Types            | Allow only                           | Allow and Deny                           |
| Evaluated For         | EC2, RDS, Lambda, ELB, etc.          | All traffic entering/exiting subnet      |
| Rule Evaluation Order | All rules evaluated (no priority)    | Rules evaluated in ascending rule order  |
| Use Case              | Control access to specific instances | Broad control of subnet-level traffic    |
| Direction Required    | Inbound or Outbound (not both)       | Both Inbound and Outbound rules required |

## Summary

- **Security Groups** are ideal for **instance-level security** and are **stateful**.
- **NACLs** are best for **subnet-level control** and are **stateless**.
- Use **Security Groups** for application-layer controls and **NACLs** for broader, low-level traffic filtering (e.g., blocking malicious IPs).
- In most cases, both will be used together for layered network security.

# What is AWS CloudFront?

**Amazon CloudFront** is a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users across the globe with **low latency and high transfer speeds**. It works by caching content at **edge locations** around the world.

## Key Features

### 1. **Global Edge Network**

- CloudFront has a global network of **Points of Presence (PoPs)** (edge locations + regional edge caches).
- Caches content closer to the end-user for faster delivery.

### 2. **Static and Dynamic Content Delivery**

- Delivers both **static content** (images, CSS, JS, videos) and **dynamic content** (APIs, HTML).
- Supports integration with **origin servers** like Amazon S3, EC2, or any custom web server.

### 3. **Origin Support**

- **Amazon S3** – for static file hosting
- **Amazon EC2 / Load Balancer** – for dynamic websites or APIs
- **Custom HTTP origin** – any web server with a public IP

### 4. **Security**

- **HTTPS support** with SSL/TLS
- **AWS Shield Standard** (DDoS protection) included by default
- **AWS WAF** integration for application-layer firewall rules
- **Signed URLs/Cookies** for secure, time-limited content access
- **Geo-restriction** to block access based on geographic location

### 5. **Performance**

- **Edge caching** reduces load on origin servers and minimizes latency
- **Compression** of objects to reduce bandwidth
- **HTTP/3 and IPv6 support**

### 6. **Real-time Logging and Monitoring**

- Integrated with **CloudWatch**, **S3**, and **Kinesis Data Firehose**
- Track performance, requests, and errors

## How CloudFront Works

1. User requests content (e.g., image, video, HTML) via a CloudFront URL
2. CloudFront checks its **nearest edge location** cache:
   - If **cached**, content is delivered immediately (low latency)
   - If **not cached**, it fetches content from the **origin server**, caches it, and then serves the user
3. Subsequent requests for the same content in that region are served from the cache

## Use Cases

- Delivering websites (static, dynamic, single-page apps)
- Streaming video on demand (HLS/DASH) or live video
- Securing and accelerating API delivery
- Serving large downloadable files (e.g., software packages)
- Reducing server load and cost via caching

## Benefits

- **Faster performance** for global users
- **Highly secure** content delivery
- **Cost savings** by reducing origin traffic
- **Easy integration** with AWS services
- **Scalable** to handle millions of requests per second

## Summary

**Amazon CloudFront** is a powerful CDN service that accelerates the delivery of websites, APIs, videos, and more. With built-in security, edge caching, and global coverage, it ensures reliable and fast user experiences while reducing backend load and bandwidth costs.
