# Types of Storage Services in AWS

AWS provides a variety of **storage services** to meet different application needs such as backup, archival, real-time data processing, and large-scale analytics. These services are categorized based on how data is accessed, stored, and managed.

## 1. **Object Storage**

### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Stores data as objects within buckets
- Ideal for unstructured data like images, videos, backups, and logs
- Scales automatically to petabytes
- Supports lifecycle policies, versioning, and event notifications

### S3 Storage Classes

- **S3 Standard** – Frequent access, low latency
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** – Auto moves data between access tiers
- **S3 Standard-IA / One Zone-IA** – Infrequent access
- **S3 Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive** – Archival storage

## 2. **Block Storage**

### Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

- Provides block-level storage for EC2 instances
- Suitable for operating systems, databases, and transactional applications
- Supports SSD (gp3, io2) and HDD (st1, sc1) volume types
- Persistent across EC2 instance stops/starts

### AWS Instance Store

- Temporary block storage physically attached to the host
- Very low latency, but non-persistent (data lost on stop/terminate)
- Best for caching or buffer storage

## 3. **File Storage**

### Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)

- Scalable NFS file system for Linux workloads
- Grows and shrinks automatically
- Accessible from multiple EC2 instances simultaneously
- Ideal for content management, development environments, shared storage

### Amazon FSx

- Managed file systems for specific use cases:
  - **FSx for Windows File Server** – SMB protocol, Windows apps
  - **FSx for Lustre** – High-performance file system for HPC, ML, big data

## 4. **Data Transfer and Hybrid Storage**

### AWS Storage Gateway

- Hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises environments to AWS
- Provides file, volume, and tape gateway configurations
- Useful for backup, disaster recovery, and low-latency data access

### AWS Snow Family

- Physical devices for transferring large datasets to AWS
- Includes **Snowcone** (< 8 TB), **Snowball** & **Snowball Edge** (50 to 80TB), and **Snowmobile** (< 100PB)
- Supports offline and edge computing scenarios

## 5. **Backup and Archival**

### AWS Backup

- Centralized backup service for AWS resources
- Supports EC2, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, and more
- Automates backup scheduling and retention policies

### Amazon S3 Glacier & Glacier Deep Archive

- Cold storage solutions for long-term data archiving
- Low-cost options with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours
- Ideal for compliance and historical data storage

# Amazon S3

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is a scalable, high-performance, object storage service provided by AWS. It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the internet, offering **durability, availability**, and **security** at scale.

## Key Features

- **Object Storage**: Stores data as objects (files), each consisting of data, metadata, and a unique identifier.
- **Unlimited Storage**: Scales automatically to store billions of objects and petabytes of data.
- **High Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability by redundantly storing data across multiple Availability Zones.
- **Multiple Storage Classes**: Optimize cost based on access patterns.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Manage access using IAM policies, bucket policies, and ACLs.
- **Event Notifications**: Trigger workflows using AWS Lambda, SQS, or SNS.
- **Static Website Hosting**: Host HTML websites directly from S3.

## Core Concepts

| Concept        | Description                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bucket**     | A container for storing S3 objects (files). Each bucket has a globally unique name.     |
| **Object**     | A file stored in a bucket. Consists of key (filename), data, and metadata.              |
| **Key**        | The unique identifier for an object within a bucket (like a path or filename).          |
| **Versioning** | Allows storing multiple versions of an object to protect against deletion or overwrite. |

## S3 Storage Classes

| Class                       | Description                                                     | Ideal Use Case                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **S3 Standard**             | Low-latency, high-throughput storage for frequent access        | Active data, websites, apps      |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**  | Automatically moves data between tiers based on access patterns | Unpredictable access             |
| **S3 Standard-IA**          | Infrequent access, lower cost, high retrieval cost              | Backups, disaster recovery       |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**          | Same as IA but in a single Availability Zone                    | Re-creatable data                |
| **S3 Glacier**              | Archival storage with retrieval times in minutes/hours          | Long-term archives               |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** | Lowest-cost storage with retrieval in hours                     | Compliance, rarely accessed data |

## Common Use Cases

- Backup and restore
- Data lakes and analytics
- Application hosting (media files, documents)
- Static website hosting
- Disaster recovery
- Software delivery and patch distribution

## Access Management

- **IAM policies**: Control access based on user roles.
- **Bucket policies**: Apply rules directly to buckets.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Control permissions at object level.
- **Pre-signed URLs**: Temporarily grant access to private objects.

## Security and Compliance

- **Encryption**: Supports server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C) and client-side encryption.
- **Access Logs**: Track requests to your buckets for auditing.
- **Bucket Versioning**: Protects against accidental deletion.
- **Replication**: Cross-Region or Same-Region Replication for redundancy or compliance.

## Data Management Features

- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automate transitions between storage classes or deletions.
- **Object Lock**: Enforce write-once-read-many (WORM) compliance.
- **Transfer Acceleration**: Speeds up upload/download via Amazon CloudFront edge locations.

## S3 Versioning

**Versioning** in Amazon S3 is a feature that allows you to keep **multiple variants of an object** in the same bucket. It protects data from accidental overwrites and deletions by maintaining a **history of changes**.

### Key Benefits

- **Accidental Recovery**: Restore accidentally deleted or overwritten objects.
- **Change Tracking**: Maintain a complete history of object changes.
- **Backup Strategy**: Useful for applications requiring rollback or audit capabilities.

### How It Works

When **versioning is enabled** on a bucket:

- Every new upload of an object (even with the same key) creates a new, unique version.
- Deleting an object creates a **delete marker**, not a permanent deletion (object can be restored).
- You can retrieve, delete, or archive specific versions of an object.

### Version ID

- Each version of an object has a **unique version ID**.
- The **latest version** is the default version retrieved unless a specific ID is requested.

### Enabling Versioning

Versioning must be explicitly enabled per bucket. Once enabled:

- It cannot be disabled, only **suspended** (to stop creating new versions).
- Example via AWS CLI:
  ```bash
  aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket my-bucket-name \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
  ```

## Summary

Amazon S3 is a powerful, flexible, and secure storage service that supports a wide variety of use cases. It forms the backbone of data storage in AWS and integrates seamlessly with almost every AWS service.

By choosing appropriate storage classes, setting lifecycle policies, and managing access controls, you can build highly efficient and cost-effective storage solutions using S3.
