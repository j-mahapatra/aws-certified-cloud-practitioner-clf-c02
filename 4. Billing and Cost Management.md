# Billing and Cost Management

AWS Billing and Cost Management is a set of tools and dashboards provided by AWS to help you track, analyze, forecast, and control your cloud spending across services, accounts, and regions.

## Core Components

### 1. AWS Billing Dashboard

- A high-level view of current and forecasted charges.
- Summary of month-to-date costs, payment methods, and account settings.

### 2. Cost Explorer

- A visual tool to explore and analyze your AWS costs.
- Allows filtering by service, linked account, region, tags, and usage type.

- **Features:**

  - Daily, monthly, and custom date range views
  - Forecasting up to 12 months based on historical data
  - Grouping by dimensions like service or usage type

### 3. Budgets

- Set custom cost or usage thresholds and get alerts when limits are crossed.

- **Types of Budgets:**

  - **Cost Budget:** Alert when total spending exceeds a threshold
  - **Usage Budget:** Based on specific usage types (e.g., EC2 hours)
  - **Savings Plans Budget:** Track and optimize savings commitment
  - **Reservation Budget:** Monitor Reserved Instances utilization

- **Alerts can be sent via:**

  - Email
  - Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

### 4. Billing Reports

- Detailed CSV reports to download or analyze in Amazon S3.
- Created using AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR), which provides the most detailed billing information available.

### 5. Consolidated Billing

- Used with AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts under one master (payer) account.
- Aggregates bills across all accounts, allowing volume discounts and easier cost allocation.

### 6. Savings Plans & Reserved Instances (RI)

- **Savings Plans:** Flexible pricing for consistent usage (e.g., EC2, Lambda, Fargate) over a 1-year or 3-year term.
- **Reserved Instances:** Pre-pay for EC2 or RDS over a fixed term to save compared to On-Demand rates.

### 7. Tax Settings and Invoicing

- Manage tax registration numbers (VAT, GST, etc.).
- Access invoices and payment history for accounting.

## Tracking and Optimization Tools

### 1. AWS Trusted Advisor

- Provides cost optimization checks (e.g., underutilized EC2 instances, idle load balancers).

### 2. AWS Compute Optimizer

- Recommends instance types that can reduce cost and improve performance.

### 3. AWS Cost Anomaly Detection

- Machine-learning based monitoring for unexpected changes in cost or usage.
- Automatically sends alerts when anomalies are detected.

## Cost Governance and Access Control

- **IAM Policies**: Grant fine-grained access to billing info.
- **Billing Access Setting**: Must be enabled to allow IAM users to view billing data.
- **Tagging**: Use cost allocation tags to group and track resources by project, team, or client.

## Common Use Cases

## NOTE

- Alarms in AWS Cloudwatch can also be used to setup alerts based on resource usage and many other metrics.
