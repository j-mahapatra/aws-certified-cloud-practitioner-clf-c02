# Virtualization

It allows the creation of multiple simulated environments or virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical hardware system. Each VM can have its own operating system and applications.

- Without Virtualization:

  Physical Hardware => Operating System => Applications

- With Virtualization:

  Physical Hardware => Hypervisor => VMs

**Hypervisor**:

- It is a software layer that allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine.
- It manages and allocates the underlying physical resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) and ensures isolation of VMs.

- Types:

  - Type-1 hypervisor (Bare-metal):
    Runs directly on the physical hardware.
    e.g. - VMWare ESXi, Xen, KVM (Linux Kernel based VM)

  - Type-2 hypervisor (Hosted):
    Runs on top of a host.
    e.g. - VMWare Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox

# What is Cloud Computing?

- On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Access computing resources (like servers, storage, database, and software) over the internet rather than owning and maintaining physical harware.
- Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.

# Evolution of Cloud Hosting

- **Dedicated Server**

  - One physical machine dedicated to a single business.
  - Runs a single website.
  - Very expensive, high maintenance, high security

- **Virtual Private Server (VPS)**

  - One physical machine dedicated to a single business.
  - The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines.
  - Runs multiple websites.
  - Better utilization and isolation of resources.

- **Shared Hosting**

  - One physical machine, shared by multiple businesses.
  - Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources.
  - Very cheap, limited functionality, poor isolation

- **Cloud Hosting**

  - Multiple physical machines that act as one system.
  - The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services.
  - Flexible, scalable, secure, cost-effective, high configurability

# Types of Cloud Computing service models

Cloud computing services are generally classified into three main models:

## 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet - like servers, storage, and networking.

**You manage:**

- Operating systems
- Applications
- Middleware
- Runtime

**Provider manages:**

- Virtual machines
- Storage
- Networking
- Physical infrastructure

**Examples:**

- AWS EC2
- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
- Google Compute Engine

**Use Cases:**

- Hosting websites
- Running virtual machines
- Development and test environments

**Pros:**

- High flexibility
- Pay-as-you-go model
- Control over environment

**Cons:**

- Requires system administration skills

## 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**Definition:**  
Provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without managing the infrastructure.

**You manage:**

- Applications
- Data

**Provider manages:**

- Operating system
- Middleware
- Runtime
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

**Examples:**

- Heroku
- Google App Engine
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

**Use Cases:**

- Rapid app development
- Deploying web apps
- Simplifying DevOps

**Pros:**

- Faster development
- No infrastructure maintenance
- Scalable and automated

**Cons:**

- Limited control over environment
- Potential vendor lock-in

## 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

**Definition:**  
Delivers ready-to-use software applications over the internet, sometimes on a subscription basis.

**You manage:**

- Data
- User access

**Provider manages:**

- Everything else (applications, infrastructure, maintenance)

**Examples:**

- Google Workspace (Docs, Gmail, etc.)
- Microsoft 365
- Salesforce
- Dropbox

**Use Cases:**

- Email and productivity apps
- CRM
- Collaboration tools

**Pros:**

- No setup or maintenance
- Accessible anywhere
- Always updated

**Cons:**

- Least control
- Data security depends on provider

# Types of Cloud Computing deployment models

## 1. Public Cloud

A cloud environment owned and operated by a third-party cloud provider (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) and delivered over the internet.

**Features:**

- Shared infrastructure among multiple organizations ("multi-tenant")

- On-demand resources like compute, storage, and networking

- Highly scalable and cost-efficient

**Use Cases:**

- Startups, SaaS apps, web hosting, development/test environments

**Pros:**

- No infrastructure management

- Pay-as-you-go pricing

- High availability and scalability

**Cons:**

- Limited control over infrastructure

- Data privacy/compliance concerns in regulated industries

## 2. Private Cloud

A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization. It can be hosted either on-premises or by a third-party vendor.

**Features:**

- Single-tenant architecture

- Greater control over security and infrastructure

**Use Cases:**

- Government agencies, financial institutions, or companies with strict regulatory requirements

**Pros:**

- High security and control

- Customizable to specific business needs

**Cons:**

- High cost for setup and maintenance

- Less scalable than public cloud due to physical and financial overhead

## 3. Hybrid Cloud

A mix of public and private cloud environments that work together, often connected via VPN or dedicated networking.

**Features:**

- Combines on-premises infrastructure with public cloud services

- Enables data and app portability

**Use Cases:**

- Disaster recovery, burst workloads, gradual cloud migration

**Pros:**

- Flexibility to run workloads in optimal environments

- Enhanced security and compliance options

**Cons:**

- Complex integration and management

- Potential latency or compatibility issues

## 4. Community Cloud

A cloud infrastructure shared by multiple organizations with common goals or compliance requirements (e.g., healthcare, banking).

**Features:**

- Can be managed internally or by a third-party

- Access limited to a specific group of users

**Use Cases:**

- Universities, government agencies, or consortiums with joint projects

**Pros:**

- Shared cost model

- Meets specialized compliance or performance needs

**Cons:**

- Less flexibility than public cloud

- Costlier than purely public cloud models
