# AWS Global Infrastructure

Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivers a secure, scalable, and highly available infrastructure that spans the globe. Its architecture is designed for high performance, fault tolerance, and low latency.

## 1. Regions

- AWS Regions are geographically distinct areas, each containing multiple isolated Availability Zones.
- Full regional isolation for fault containment
- Regions comply with data residency requirements
- Named like `us-east-1`, `ap-south-1`, etc.
- An AWS service can be region-specific (e.g. - EC2) or global (e.g. - S3) depending on the service.

## 2. Availability Zones (AZs)

- Availability Zones are groups of one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- Each region contains at least two AZs.
- Low-latency links between AZs (generally < 10ms).
- Supports high availability and fault tolerance.
- AZs are represented by region code followed by a letter. e.g. - `ap-south-1a`, `ap-south-1b`, etc.
- It is common practice to run workloads in atleast 3 AZs to ensure high availability.
- A subnet is associated with an AZ. When launching resources, subnet corresponding to the required AZ is selected.

## 3. Data Centers

Each AZ includes multiple data centers, purpose-built for:

- Physical and logical security
- High redundancy (power, cooling, networking)
- Disaster recovery and backup

## 4. Edge Locations

- Edge Locations support AWS services like Amazon CloudFront, Route 53, and Global Accelerator.
- Over 400 Edge Locations globally
- Deliver static/dynamic content with low latency
- Located in major cities worldwide
- Edge locations can act as on and off ramps to the AWS Global Network (e.g. - AWS Global Accelerator and AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration use Edge locations as an on-ramp to quickly reach AWS resources in other regions by traversing the fast AWS Global Network. Amazon Cloudfront (CDN) uses Edge locations as on off-ramp to provide at the Edge storage and compute near the end-user).

## 5. Regional Edge Caches

- Intermediate caching layers between edge locations and origin servers.
- Improve performance for larger files
- Reduce load on your backend servers
- Enhance cache hit ratios

## 6. Direct Connect

- AWS Direct Connect offers private, high-throughput connections between your infrastructure and AWS.
- Bypasses the public internet for consistent performance.
- Lower latency and increased bandwidth throughput, causing reduced network costs.
- Provides two very-fast network connection options:
  - Lower Bandwidth: 50MBps - 500MBps
  - Higher Bandwidth: 1GBps - 10GBps

**Direct Connect Locations:**

- Trusted partnered data-centers that an on-premise server can connect to, using Direct Connect.
- 100+ global locations at top colocation facilities
- Examples:
  - Equinix – Ashburn, VA (US)
  - Global Switch – Sydney, Australia
  - Interxion – Paris, France

## 7. Points of Presence (PoPs)

- PoP is an intermediate location between an AWS region and the end-user, and this location can be a data-center or a collection of hardware, either owned by AWS or a trusted partner, prominently used for content-delivery or expediated upload.
- PoPs are the global network endpoints used for AWS edge services.
- Includes Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches.
- Over 100 cities in 50+ countries.
- Designed for low-latency, high-availability edge connectivity.
- The following AWS services use PoPs for content delivery or expediated upload:
  - AWS Cloudfront: CDN service
  - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration: It is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 general purpose bucket.
  - Amazon Global Accelerator: It is a networking service that improves the availability and performance of applications with global users by routing user traffic through the closest endpoint within the AWS's global infrastructure.

## 8. AWS Global Backbone Network

AWS owns and operates a private global fiber-optic network:

- Interconnects all regions, AZs, and edge sites
- Ensures high-speed, secure data transfers
- Used internally by services like VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, and Direct Connect

## 9. Local Zones

- AWS Local Zones extend AWS services closer to end users in major metropolitan areas.
- Ideal for latency-sensitive use cases like video rendering, gaming, and hybrid cloud
- Provide ultra-low latencies (single-digit)
- Operate as extensions of a parent region
- Services like EC2, EBS, ALB, and more are available locally

Examples:

- Los Angeles, CA
- Dallas, TX
- Chennai, India

## 10. Wavelength Zones

- AWS Wavelength brings AWS compute and storage to the edge of 5G networks.
- Deployed over telecom providers' 5G networks
- Enables ultra-low latency (single-digit ms) for mobile and edge devices
- Used in AR/VR, live streaming, and autonomous systems
- Partners:
  - Verizon (US)
  - Vodafone (UK)
  - KDDI (Japan)
  - SK Telecom (Korea)

## 11. AWS Partitions

AWS groups Regions into partitions. Every Region is in exactly one partition, and each partition has one or more Regions. Partitions have independent instances of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and provide a hard boundary between Regions in different partitions. AWS commercial Regions are in the aws partition, Regions in China are in the aws-cn partition, and AWS GovCloud Regions are in the aws-us-gov partition.

# Fault Tolerance

## Fault Domain

- A fault domain is a logical grouping of infrastructure components in a network within which a single failure event is likely to affect all resources within that grouping only and not outside. In simpler terms, it's a boundary within which a hardware failure, network outage, or power disruption could impact all the resources deployed in that domain but not outside.

- The scope of a fault domain could be:

  - Some specific servers in a rack
  - An entire rack in a data-center
  - An entire room in a data-center
  - An entire data-center building

- The fault domains are defined by CSPs.
- In AWS, "Failure Zone" is often used to refer a fault domain.

## Fault Level

- It is a collection of fault domains.
- E.g. - A region could be a fault level with its AZs as fault domains.

# Data Residency

It refers to the physical or geographic location where data is stored and where it must remain, often due to legal, regulatory, or compliance requirements. It dictates where your data is held, processed, and governed.

# Compliance boundaries

- Compliance boundaries refer to the logical or physical separations that cloud providers establish to ensure data handling complies with various regulatory and legal requirements.

- **Key aspects:**

  - Geographical: Cloud providers may keep data within specific regions (e.g., EU, US, India) to meet compliance rules.

  - Legal Jurisdiction: Compliance boundaries help ensure data does not cross into territories where it would be subject to a different legal system.

  - Tenant Isolation: In multi-tenant environments, compliance boundaries ensure your data and workloads are isolated from others to meet standards like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.

  - Audit and Certification Zones: Services within certain boundaries may be certified (e.g., FedRAMP, GDPR-compliant).

  - For example, AWS has GovCloud (US) regions for workloads that must comply with US government regulations.

# Data Sovereignty

- Data sovereignty is the concept that data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the country in which it is physically stored.

- **Key aspects:**

  - If you store data in France, it is subject to French and EU laws, even if you are a company based in the US.

  - Some countries enforce data localization laws, requiring certain types of data (e.g., personal, financial, health) to be stored only within their borders.

  - Non-compliance may lead to legal penalties, data seizure, or breach of contract.

  - Example: India’s Personal Data Protection Bill requires critical personal data to be stored only within India.

  - AWS China (domain: amazonaws.cn) (Beijing and Ningxia regions) is physically and legally isolated from other AWS global regions due to Chinese data sovereignty laws and regulatory requirements.

# Sustainability

- Sustainability in the context of AWS refers to efforts made by Amazon Web Services to minimize environmental impact and help customers build energy-efficient, low-carbon cloud solutions.

- **Key Aspects:**

  - Renewable Energy Use: AWS aims to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. As of now, it’s the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy globally.

  - Efficient Infrastructure: AWS data centers are designed for energy and water efficiency, using custom-built hardware and cooling technologies.

  - Shared Responsibility Model: AWS handles sustainability of the cloud (infrastructure, energy, operations). Customers are responsible for sustainability in the cloud (optimizing workloads, storage, architecture).

  - Tools for Customers:Customer Carbon Footprint Tool: Lets users track their cloud-related emissions. Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar: Helps customers design eco-friendly cloud architectures.

- **Benefits:**

  - Lower carbon footprint vs on-prem infrastructure

  - Reduced energy waste through shared resources

  - Innovation in green technologies and operations
