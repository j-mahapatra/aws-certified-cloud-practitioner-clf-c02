# Governance in AWS Using Organizations and Accounts

**Governance** in AWS refers to the set of practices, tools, and frameworks used to **manage and control access, security, compliance, and costs** across multiple AWS environments. A key foundation for strong governance in AWS is using **AWS Organizations** and **multiple AWS accounts**.

## Why Use Multiple AWS Accounts?

Managing workloads in **separate AWS accounts** enables:

- **Isolation**: Security and resource boundaries between environments (e.g., dev, test, prod)
- **Billing Separation**: Track costs by project, team, or department
- **Limit Blast Radius**: Contain the impact of security incidents
- **Compliance & Access Control**: Easier enforcement of controls and policies

## What is AWS Organizations?

**AWS Organizations** is a service that helps you centrally **manage and govern multiple AWS accounts**. It enables consolidated billing, service control policies (SCPs), and account structure.

### Key Features

- **Organizational Units (OUs)**: Group accounts logically (e.g., by team, environment, business unit)
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Set permission boundaries across accounts and OUs
- **Centralized Billing**: Consolidate bills for all accounts under a single payment method
- **Account Automation**: Use **AWS Control Tower** to automate account creation and setup

## Organizational Hierarchy Example

```
Root
│
├── OU: Infrastructure
│ ├── Account: Networking
│ └── Account: Logging
│
├── OU: Development
│ ├── Account: Dev Team A
│ └── Account: Dev Team B
│
└── OU: Production
├── Account: Prod App 1
└── Account: Prod App 2
```

## Service Control Policies (SCPs)

SCPs are permission boundaries applied to AWS accounts and OUs. They do **not grant permissions** directly but define the **maximum available permissions**.

### Example Use Cases

- Deny use of expensive services like EC2 GPU instances
- Prevent use of specific regions (e.g., deny all except `us-east-1`)
- Require encryption for all S3 buckets across accounts

## Tools Supporting Governance
