# AWS Consolidated Billing

**Consolidated Billing** is a feature of **AWS Organizations** that enables you to **combine billing across multiple AWS accounts** into a **single payment account** (also called the **management account**).

It simplifies billing and accounting for large organizations, teams, or subsidiaries while allowing each AWS account to maintain **independent resources, policies, and access**.

## Key Features

### 1. **One Bill for Multiple Accounts**

- All charges across **linked member accounts** roll up to the **management account**.
- You receive **a single monthly invoice** for all usage.

### 2. **Cost Visibility and Allocation**

- View combined usage across the organization or **break down costs by account**.
- Use **cost allocation tags** and **Cost Explorer** to analyze and report spending.

### 3. **Volume Discounts and Sharing**

- **AWS service pricing benefits** like Reserved Instance (RI) and Savings Plans are shared across accounts:
  - Unused RI capacity can be applied to other accounts in the org.
  - Savings Plans are automatically applied to maximize overall discounts.

### 4. **Centralized Payment and Control**

- Manage all billing, budgets, and credits from a central account.
- Maintain **separate account access** for teams or departments.

## Benefits

- **Simplified billing** for finance teams
- **Reduced costs** through RI and Savings Plan sharing
- **Better control** over cloud spend across departments or projects
- **Improved visibility** for tracking and forecasting

## How It Works

1. **Create an AWS Organization** using the AWS Organizations service.
2. **Invite member accounts** to join (or create them under the org).
3. Enable **Consolidated Billing** (enabled by default for Organizations).
4. Use the **Billing dashboard** in the management account to view total and individual usage.

## Use Cases

- Enterprises managing multiple business units or departments
- MSPs (Managed Service Providers) managing multiple clients
- Startups separating dev, test, and production accounts
- Organizations wanting **security isolation** + **billing aggregation**

## Key Terms

| Term                      | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Management Account**    | The master account responsible for paying the bill |
| **Member Account**        | An AWS account under the same organization         |
| **Linked Account**        | Alternate term for member account (legacy)         |
| **RI Sharing**            | Reserved Instances shared across accounts          |
| **Savings Plans Sharing** | Savings benefits automatically shared              |

## Limitations

- All charges are paid by the management account (individual account billing is not supported).
- Cannot split invoices per account — use **Cost Explorer** or **custom reports** for internal chargebacks.
- Credits (e.g., promotional credits) may not be shareable across all accounts.

## Summary

| Feature                   | Description                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| One Bill                  | Consolidates charges from all accounts     |
| RI & Savings Plan Sharing | Automatically applied for cost efficiency  |
| Cost Allocation           | Track by account, tag, or service          |
| Use Cases                 | Multi-department, multi-team, multi-client |
| Setup                     | AWS Organizations → Add accounts           |

# Consolidated Billing Volume Discounts

## What Are Volume Discounts?

**Volume discounts** in AWS refer to **automatic price reductions** applied when your total usage of a specific service reaches certain thresholds. These discounts are part of AWS's **tiered pricing model**, where **unit costs decrease** as you consume more.

When you use **Consolidated Billing** in **AWS Organizations**, these volume discounts are **applied to the combined usage** across all linked accounts — maximizing savings for the whole organization.

## How Consolidated Billing Helps

With Consolidated Billing:

- **Usage across all accounts is aggregated** to determine eligibility for discounts.
- **All member accounts benefit** from the combined volume.
- Discounts are automatically **shared and applied** across the organization.

## Examples of Volume Discounted Services

### 1. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

- Pricing tiers are based on the **total amount of data stored**.
- Example:
  - First 50 TB: $0.023/GB
  - Next 450 TB: $0.022/GB
  - Over 500 TB: $0.021/GB
- With consolidated billing, S3 usage across all accounts counts toward these thresholds.

### 2. **Amazon EC2 Data Transfer**

- Outbound data transfer volume is pooled.
- The more data you transfer out, the lower the cost per GB.

### 3. **Amazon CloudFront**

- Lower pricing tiers apply as total traffic across accounts increases.

## Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans

### RI Sharing:

- Unused **EC2 Reserved Instances** in one account can be automatically applied to matching usage in other accounts in the same consolidated billing family.

### Savings Plans Sharing:

- Usage from all accounts contributes to a single **Savings Plan commitment**.
- Savings are **applied organization-wide**, maximizing cost efficiency.

## Summary of Benefits

| Benefit                     | Description                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pooled Usage                | Usage from all linked accounts is counted together             |
| Automatic Application       | Discounts and RI/Savings Plan benefits apply automatically     |
| Cost Savings                | Larger combined usage leads to deeper volume discounts         |
| Simplified Finance Tracking | All discounts shown in the management account's billing report |
| Efficient RI Utilization    | Idle RIs in one account reduce costs in another                |

# SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs in AWS and Cloud Computing

## Overview

In cloud computing, especially in **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** and operations, three terms are frequently used to define and measure service quality:

- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** – external, contractual commitment
- **SLO (Service Level Objective)** – internal performance goal
- **SLI (Service Level Indicator)** – metric used to measure performance

These concepts help organizations maintain **high service reliability**, track **customer satisfaction**, and **plan for error budgets**.

## What is an SLA?

A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is a **contract** between a service provider (like AWS) and its customer, defining the expected **service availability and performance**, and the **remedies** if those targets are not met.

### Components of an SLA:

- **Uptime commitment** (e.g., 99.99% monthly)
- **Measurement period** (usually monthly)
- **Service credits** (issued when SLA is breached)
- **Exclusions** (planned downtime, misconfigurations)

### Example:

- **Amazon EC2 SLA**: 99.99% uptime per region (when instances are distributed across multiple AZs)

## What is an SLO?

A **Service Level Objective (SLO)** is an **internal performance target** or goal that a team or company aims to meet for a particular service.

- **Not legally binding** like an SLA
- Helps guide **reliability engineering**, development priorities, and alerting
- Should be **tighter than SLAs** to leave room for unexpected issues

### Example:

- Internal SLO for a web app:
  - “99.95% of requests must respond in under 400 ms over a 30-day period”

## What is an SLI?

A **Service Level Indicator (SLI)** is a **measurable metric** that represents the actual performance of a service against its defined objective.

- Used to calculate whether an SLO is met
- Common SLIs: availability, latency, throughput, error rate

### Examples:

| SLI Type     | Example Metric                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Availability | % of successful HTTP 200 responses    |
| Latency      | % of requests completed < 500 ms      |
| Error Rate   | % of requests returning 5xx responses |
| Throughput   | Requests per second (RPS)             |

## Relationship: SLI → SLO → SLA

```
SLI (What you measure)
 → feeds into →
SLO (The goal you set)
 → forms the basis of →
SLA (The legal promise you make)
```

## AWS SLA Examples (Tied to SLOs and SLIs)

| AWS Service           | SLA Uptime | Typical SLO (Internal) | Example SLI                             |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Amazon EC2            | 99.99%     | 99.995%                | Uptime % of instances across AZs        |
| Amazon S3             | 99.9%      | 99.95%                 | % of successful GET/PUT object requests |
| Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ) | 99.95%     | 99.98%                 | DB connection success rate              |

## Service Credits for SLA Breaches

- AWS provides service credits if SLA commitments are not met.

- Customers must submit a claim within a specified period (usually 30 days).

- Credits apply toward future AWS usage (not cash refunds).

## Summary Table

| Term | Stands For              | Purpose                           | Audience        | Binding? |
| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| SLI  | Service Level Indicator | Measures actual performance       | Internal        | No       |
| SLO  | Service Level Objective | Sets internal performance targets | Engineers/Ops   | No       |
| SLA  | Service Level Agreement | External commitment to customers  | Customers/Legal | Yes      |

## Best Practices

- Set realistic SLOs based on current SLIs before committing to SLAs

- Monitor SLIs continuously using tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus

- Use SLOs to guide development, reliability engineering, and feature prioritization

- Maintain an error budget to balance reliability with innovation

# AWS Credits

**AWS Credits** are **promotional balances** provided by Amazon Web Services that customers can use to **offset their AWS usage charges**. Credits reduce the amount billed to your account, helping you experiment, build, and scale without immediate financial commitment.

They are especially common for **startups, students, nonprofits, researchers**, and participants in AWS programs.

## How AWS Credits Work

- Credits are automatically **applied to your monthly AWS bill** until they are used up or expire.
- They are **non-transferrable**, **non-refundable**, and **expire after a defined period**.
- Credits apply to most AWS services unless otherwise restricted.

## Types of AWS Credits

| Credit Type                           | Description                                     | Who It's For                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

# AWS Cost Allocation Tags

**Cost Allocation Tags** in AWS are metadata labels that you assign to your AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases) to **categorize and track AWS costs**.

They allow you to organize resources by **project, environment, team, department, customer, or cost center**, and then **analyze costs** based on those groupings in tools like **Cost Explorer**, **AWS Budgets**, and **Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)**.

## Types of Cost Allocation Tags

| Tag Type               | Description                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS-Generated Tags** | Automatically created by AWS (e.g., `aws:createdBy`)        |
| **User-Defined Tags**  | Custom tags you define and assign (e.g., `Project`, `Team`) |

> Only **enabled tags** will appear in billing and cost tools.

## Example Use Cases

| Tag Key       | Tag Value         | Purpose                               |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Environment` | `Production`      | Track costs per environment           |
| `Project`     | `WebsiteRedesign` | Attribute costs to a specific project |
| `Team`        | `Marketing`       | Monitor departmental spending         |
| `Client`      | `ClientX`         | Billback external customer costs      |

## How Cost Allocation Tags Work

1. **Tag Resources**:

   - Use AWS Console, CLI, SDK, or CloudFormation to apply tags to resources.
   - Apply consistently across services and regions.

2. **Enable Tags for Billing**:

   - Go to **Billing Console → Cost Allocation Tags**
   - Select and enable user-defined or AWS-generated tags
   - Tags must be **explicitly activated** to appear in billing reports

3. **View Costs by Tags**:
   - Use **Cost Explorer**, **Budgets**, or **CUR**
   - Filter or group costs by tag values

## Best Practices

- Use **standardized tag keys** (case-sensitive and consistent)
- Establish **tagging policies** via AWS Organizations or SCPs
- Use **AWS Tag Editor** to manage tags across resources
- Periodically **audit untagged resources**
- Enable **tag-based access control** via IAM for governance

## Tools That Support Cost Allocation Tags

| AWS Tool                        | Usage                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost Explorer**               | Visualize and filter costs by tags          |
| **AWS Budgets**                 | Create tag-specific cost or usage budgets   |
| **CUR (Cost and Usage Report)** | Analyze hourly/daily costs by tag           |
| **Resource Groups**             | Organize and manage resources by shared tag |
| **Athena + CUR**                | Run SQL queries grouped by tag keys         |

# AWS Billing Alarms

**Billing alarms** in AWS are alerts that notify you when your **estimated charges exceed a specified threshold**. They help you **monitor and control your AWS spending** in real time and avoid unexpected billing surprises.

Billing alarms are created using **Amazon CloudWatch** and based on the **AWS Billing and Cost Management** service's metrics.

## Key Features

- Trigger alerts **based on total account-level charges**
- Receive **email or SNS notifications**
- Support both **monthly charges** and **forecasted charges**
- Works **across all AWS services and regions**
- Can be used by the **management account** in an organization

> Note: Billing alarms are **only available in the US East (N. Virginia) region**, regardless of your actual resource locations.

## Common Use Cases

- Alert when total monthly AWS spend exceeds $100
- Notify finance or operations teams when forecasted charges are unusually high
- Track spend on a free-tier or demo account
- Detect billing spikes due to unintentional resource use

## How Billing Alarms Work

### 1. Enable Billing Metrics

Before you can create a billing alarm, you must **enable billing metrics**:

- Go to **Billing Console → Preferences**
- Check **"Receive Billing Alerts"**
- This enables cost metrics in **CloudWatch**

### 2. Create a CloudWatch Alarm

Use the CloudWatch console or CLI to:

- Select the metric:
  - `EstimatedCharges` (actual spend)
  - `ForecastedCharges` (predicted spend)
- Set conditions:
  - Example: Alarm if charges > $100
- Choose actions:
  - Send email notification via **SNS topic**
  - Trigger automated actions (optional)

### 3. Monitor and Respond

- Get notified when charges exceed your threshold
- Take action (e.g., investigate cost drivers, shut down unused resources)

## Example: Email Billing Alarm

1. Enable billing alerts in Billing Preferences
2. Go to **CloudWatch → Alarms → Create Alarm**
3. Choose:
   - Metric: `Billing → Total Estimated Charges`
   - Region: US East (N. Virginia)
   - Threshold: Greater than $50
4. Attach to an **SNS topic** with email subscribers
5. Confirm the email subscription
6. Done! You'll get an alert when your usage crosses $50

## Metrics Available for Billing Alarms

| Metric Name         | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `EstimatedCharges`  | Actual usage costs accrued to date    |
| `ForecastedCharges` | Predicted total charges for the month |

You can also filter metrics by:

- AWS service (e.g., EC2, S3)
- Linked account (in organizations)

## Limitations

- Billing metrics update **3–6 hours** after changes
- Cannot create alarms on **service-specific** costs unless using Cost Explorer or Budgets
- Only available in **US East (N. Virginia)** region

## Billing Alarms vs. AWS Budgets

# AWS Pricing APIs

**AWS Pricing APIs** provide programmatic access to **AWS service pricing information**. These APIs allow developers, analysts, and tools to **query real-time pricing data** for AWS services, regions, usage types, and purchase models (On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, etc.).

They are useful for **cost estimation, pricing comparison, and automation** of billing-aware workflows.

## Key AWS Pricing APIs

### 1. **AWS Price List API (Service API)**

- Also known as the **Pricing API v1**
- Returns AWS price information in **JSON** format
- Available via **REST** or **SDKs**
- Accessible via `pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

### 2. **Get Products API**

- **Most commonly used** operation
- Allows querying of detailed pricing info

```http
POST / GetProducts
```

#### Parameters:

- ServiceCode: (e.g., AmazonEC2, AmazonS3)

- Filters: By region, instance type, tenancy, OS, etc.

- FormatVersion: aws_v1

- MaxResults, NextToken for pagination

#### Example Use Case:

Retrieve all Linux EC2 On-Demand prices in us-east-1 for t3.micro.

### 3. **Describe Services API**

- Lists all available services supported by the Pricing API.

```http
POST / DescribeServices
```

- Useful for discovering available ServiceCode values like AmazonEC2, AmazonRDS, AmazonS3.

### 4. **Get Attribute Values API**

- Lists possible values for a specific attribute of a service (e.g., instance type, region, OS).

```http
POST / GetAttributeValues
```

- Useful for discovering available ServiceCode values like AmazonEC2, AmazonRDS, AmazonS3.

- Example:
  List all EC2 instance types under AmazonEC2 with:

  ```json
  {
    "ServiceCode": "AmazonEC2",
    "AttributeName": "instanceType"
  }
  ```

### Sample Use Case: Pricing Lookup Workflow

- Use `DescribeServices` to find the service code (e.g., `AmazonEC2`)

- Use `GetAttributeValues` to get instance types or regions

- Use `GetProducts` to query price details using filters

### Example Tools That Use Pricing APIs

- AWS Pricing Calculator (behind the scenes)

- Custom cost estimation tools

- Terraform modules and infrastructure as code planners

- Billing automation scripts

- Cost dashboards and analytics platforms

### Key Output Fields from GetProducts

- `OnDemand` / `Reserved` pricing models

- `unit` (e.g., Hrs, GB-Mo)

- `pricePerUnit` (USD)

- `tenancy` (Shared/Dedicated)

- `operatingSystem`

- `instanceType`

- `location` (region)

- `termAttributes` (for RIs)

### Limitations

- Available only in us-east-1 region

- Large datasets (e.g., EC2) may require pagination

- Not ideal for real-time billing or actual account usage (use Cost Explorer/CUR for that)

## SDK and CLI Access

### **AWS CLI Example**

```bash
aws pricing get-products \
  --service-code AmazonEC2 \
  --filters Type=TERM_MATCH,Field=instanceType,Value=t3.micro \
  --region us-east-1
```

### AWS SDK (Python / Boto3)

```python
import boto3
client = boto3.client('pricing', region_name='us-east-1')

response = client.get_products(
    ServiceCode='AmazonEC2',
    Filters=[
        {'Type': 'TERM_MATCH', 'Field': 'instanceType', 'Value': 't3.micro'},
        {'Type': 'TERM_MATCH', 'Field': 'location', 'Value': 'US East (N. Virginia)'}
    ]
)
```
