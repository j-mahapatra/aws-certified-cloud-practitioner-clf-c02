# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- It is a secure, flexible access control system provided by AWS.
- It enables you to manage who (users, roles, services) can access what (resources like EC2, S3, Lambda) and how (via permissions and policies) in your AWS account.

# Key Concepts of IAM

## 1. Users

- Represent individual people or services.
- Each user can have credentials (passwords, access keys).
- Used when direct access to AWS is needed (e.g., developer login or API access).

## 2. Groups

- Collections of users.
- Simplifies permissions management (e.g., give all developers the same access).
- Permissions are assigned to groups, not individual users.

## 3. Roles

- Intended for temporary access.
- Used by AWS services, applications, or even users from external accounts.
- Example: EC2 assumes a role to access S3 without storing access keys.

## 4. Policies

- JSON documents that define permissions (allow/deny).
- Attached to users, groups, or roles.
- Follow a structure:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:PutObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
  }
  ```

## 5. Principals

Any entity (user, role, service) that can make a request to AWS.

## 6. Resources

AWS objects you want to control access to (e.g., S3 buckets, EC2 instances).

# IAM Access Types

| Access Type             | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Console Access**      | Web-based AWS Management Console (login via username/password) |
| **Programmatic Access** | CLI/SDK/API access (via access keys or assumed roles)          |

# IAM Common Scenarios

1. A developer logs into the console:

   - IAM user is created.

   - Console password set.

   - Permissions assigned via group or inline policy.

2. An EC2 instance uploads files to S3:

   - EC2 instance has an IAM role attached.

   - The role grants s3:PutObject permission to a specific bucket.

3. A third-party app assumes a role:

   - IAM role with trust policy allows external AWS account.

   - Temporary credentials are issued for limited access.

# Types of IAM Policies

| Policy Type                         | Attached To                 | Example Use Case                          |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Managed Policies**                | AWS or customer managed     | Reusable, standardized permissions        |
| **Inline Policies**                 | Embedded in one entity      | Specific to a user/role for tight control |
| **Permission Boundaries**           | Limit user/role permissions | Prevent privilege escalation              |
| **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** | AWS Organizations           | Set guardrails for child accounts         |

# IAM Best Practices

- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all users.

- Use roles for AWS services (instead of hardcoding credentials).

- Grant least privilege: only the permissions a user/service needs.

- Rotate credentials regularly.

- Use groups for managing access at scale.

- Monitor using CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer.
