# AWS Shared Responsibility Model

The **AWS Shared Responsibility Model** defines the division of responsibilities between **AWS** and the **customer** to ensure security and compliance in the cloud.

## Overview

In this model:

- **AWS** is responsible for the security _of_ the cloud.
- **Customer** is responsible for the security _in_ the cloud.

## AWS Responsibilities (Security of the Cloud)

AWS manages and controls components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate.

### Examples:

- Physical infrastructure (data centers, networking, hardware)
- Global and regional infrastructure (availability zones, edge locations)
- Software that runs AWS services (compute, storage, database, etc.)
- Patching of infrastructure components

## Customer Responsibilities (Security in the Cloud)

Customers are responsible for managing and securing their own data, identities, applications, and configurations.

### Examples:

- Data encryption and integrity authentication
- Managing users and permissions (IAM)
- Configuring security groups and firewalls
- Application-level security
- Operating system and network configuration
- Patching guest OS and applications (in EC2 or containers)

## Responsibility by Service Type

| AWS Service Model           | AWS Responsibility               | Customer Responsibility                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **IaaS (e.g., EC2)**        | Infra security, hypervisor, etc. | OS patching, software, IAM, network, data encryption |
| **PaaS (e.g., RDS)**        | Database engine and infra        | Database configuration, data, IAM                    |
| **SaaS (e.g., S3, Lambda)** | Full service operation           | Data, IAM, access control, usage policies            |

## Summary

The shared responsibility model helps customers understand their role in maintaining a secure cloud environment. While AWS ensures the infrastructure is secure, customers must secure what they build and store on it.

# Types of Cloud Responsibilities

Cloud responsibilities refer to the various security, operational, and compliance duties shared between a cloud provider (like AWS) and the customer. These responsibilities vary depending on the **cloud service model** used: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.

## 1. **Infrastructure Responsibilities**

### AWS (Provider)

- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware maintenance
- Network infrastructure
- Hypervisor/virtualization layer

### Customer

- Provisioning virtual servers (e.g., EC2)
- OS installation, patching, and maintenance
- Network configuration (e.g., subnets, security groups)

## 2. **Data Responsibilities**

### AWS

- Secure storage infrastructure
- Data durability and availability (e.g., replication in S3)

### Customer

- Data classification
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Backup and recovery strategies
- Data lifecycle management

## 3. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

### AWS

- IAM service provisioning
- Secure APIs and tools

### Customer

- Creating users, groups, and roles
- Enforcing least privilege
- Enabling MFA and access policies

## 4. **Application Responsibilities**

### AWS

- Underlying compute and storage for managed services

### Customer

- Application code
- Business logic
- Application security (e.g., input validation, secure coding)

## 5. **Compliance Responsibilities**

### AWS

- Compliance with global standards (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2)
- Providing audit reports and shared compliance models

### Customer

- Industry-specific compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR)
- Ensuring correct configurations and record-keeping
- Audit preparation and access controls

## 6. **Monitoring and Logging**

### AWS

- Provides tools like CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Config

### Customer

- Configure logging, alarms, and monitoring
- Analyze logs and respond to incidents
- Set up billing alarms and usage monitoring

## Summary

| Responsibility Area | AWS (Provider)                    | Customer                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Infrastructure      | Physical infra, hypervisor        | OS, firewall, network settings |
| Data                | Storage services, durability      | Encryption, classification     |
| IAM                 | IAM service                       | Policies, access controls      |
| Applications        | Platform or runtime management    | App logic, security            |
| Compliance          | Global standards & certifications | Customer-specific compliance   |
