# AWS CloudTrail

**AWS CloudTrail** is a **fully managed service** that provides **visibility into user activity and API usage** across your AWS account. It records every action taken by a user, role, or AWS service, and delivers **event logs** to **Amazon S3**, **CloudWatch Logs**, or **CloudTrail Lake**.

It is essential for **security auditing, compliance monitoring, resource change tracking**, and **troubleshooting operational issues**.

---

## What CloudTrail Tracks

CloudTrail captures API activity from:

- AWS Management Console
- AWS CLI
- AWS SDKs
- AWS services (automated activity)

Each **event record** contains details such as:

- **Who** made the request (user/role)
- **What** was requested (API action)
- **When** the action occurred (timestamp)
- **Where** it came from (IP address, region)
- **Whether** it succeeded or failed

---

## Types of Events Captured

| Event Type            | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Management Events** | Control plane actions (e.g., create/delete/modify resources) |
| **Data Events**       | High-volume, data-level actions (e.g., S3 object access)     |
| **Insights Events**   | Anomalies in write or read behavior                          |

---

# Amazon CloudWatch Alarm

An **Amazon CloudWatch Alarm** is a **monitoring tool** that lets you **automatically respond to changes in your AWS environment** by tracking **metric thresholds or anomaly detection models**. When a specified condition is met, the alarm triggers **actions like sending notifications, stopping/starting EC2 instances, or executing Auto Scaling policies**.

CloudWatch Alarms help you maintain **application health, automate recovery, and stay ahead of operational issues**.

## How It Works

1. You **specify a metric** (e.g., CPUUtilization, RequestCount).
2. Define a **threshold** (e.g., CPU > 80%).
3. Set an **evaluation period** (e.g., 3 out of 5 consecutive minutes).
4. When the condition is met, the alarm **enters ALARM state**.
5. It can then **trigger actions** like:
   - **SNS notification**
   - **EC2 instance action**
   - **Auto Scaling policy**
   - **Systems Manager automation**

## CloudWatch Alarm States

| State                 | Meaning                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OK**                | Metric is within defined thresholds                             |
| **ALARM**             | Metric is outside of the threshold (violation occurred)         |
| **INSUFFICIENT_DATA** | Not enough data to determine alarm state (e.g., missing metric) |

## Types of Alarms

### 1. **Static Threshold Alarm**

- Triggers when a metric crosses a defined value
- Example: Alarm when `CPUUtilization > 80% for 5 minutes`

### 2. **Anomaly Detection Alarm**

- Uses machine learning to automatically detect unusual metric patterns
- Triggers when a metric deviates from a **predicted band**

### 3. **Composite Alarm**

- Combines multiple alarms into a **single logical alarm**
- Useful for reducing alert noise or aggregating related alarms

## Example Use Cases

| Use Case                      | Alarm Configuration Example                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High CPU usage                | Trigger alarm if `CPUUtilization > 80% for 5 minutes`            |
| EC2 instance health           | Alarm if `StatusCheckFailed > 0`                                 |
| S3 error rate monitoring      | Alarm if `4xxErrors > 100`                                       |
| Auto Scaling                  | Increase instance count if `CPUUtilization > 70%` for 10 minutes |
| Anomaly detection for traffic | Alert if `RequestCount` deviates from historical pattern         |

## Alarm Actions

- **Notify via SNS**: Email, SMS, Lambda, or HTTP webhook
- **Start/stop/reboot/terminate EC2 instance**
- **Execute Auto Scaling policy**
- **Trigger Systems Manager automation**

## Integration with Other AWS Services

| Service                 | Role in Alarm Workflow                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Amazon SNS**          | Delivers notifications when alarm state changes  |
| **EC2**                 | Can be stopped, started, or rebooted by alarms   |
| **Auto Scaling**        | Scale in/out based on alarm conditions           |
| **AWS Lambda**          | Custom logic on alarm trigger                    |
| **AWS Systems Manager** | Run documents or workflows in response to alarms |

## Sample Alarm Configuration (via AWS Console)

- Metric: `CPUUtilization`
- Namespace: `AWS/EC2`
- Statistic: `Average`
- Period: `300 seconds`
- Threshold: `GreaterThanThreshold` - 80%
- Evaluation Periods: 2
- Actions:
  - Notify `SNS Topic: HighCPUAlerts`
  - Auto scale up EC2 instances

## Best Practices

- Use **anomaly detection** for dynamic baselines
- Combine related alarms into a **composite alarm**
- Set appropriate **cooldown periods** to avoid alert fatigue
- Use **CloudWatch Dashboards** to visualize alarms alongside metrics
- Ensure **SNS topics** have proper subscribers and alerting integrations

## Summary

**Amazon CloudWatch Alarms** are essential for **real-time awareness and automated incident response** in AWS. Whether you're monitoring system health, app performance, or user activity, alarms help you stay proactive and responsive by alerting or taking corrective actions automatically.

# AWS CloudWatch Logs

**Amazon CloudWatch Logs** is a fully managed service that allows you to **collect, store, monitor, and analyze log data** from AWS services, applications, and on-premises environments. It helps you troubleshoot errors, monitor performance, detect anomalies, and retain logs for compliance or audit purposes.

---

## Key Concepts: Log Groups and Log Streams

### 1. **Log Groups**

- A **log group** is a container for log streams that **share the same retention, permissions, and monitoring settings**.
- Typically, you create **one log group per application or service**.
- You can set:
  - **Retention policy** (1 day to infinite)
  - **Metric filters**
  - **Access control policies**
  - **Subscription filters** for streaming logs

**Example**: A log group named `/app/frontend` might contain all logs from the frontend tier of your application.

---

### 2. **Log Streams**

- A **log stream** is a **sequence of log events** from a single source within a log group.
- Each log stream is **time-ordered**, and new events are always appended.
- A log stream is typically tied to **a single resource**, such as:
  - An EC2 instance
  - A Lambda function invocation
  - A container instance

**Example**: Within the `/app/frontend` log group, you might have log streams like:

- `i-0abc123d (EC2 instance)`
- `lambda-UserSignupHandler (Lambda function)`
- `task/app-frontend-service (ECS task)`

---

## Log Lifecycle in CloudWatch

[Source] → [Log Stream] → [Log Group] → [Retention & Archival] → [Querying & Analysis]

- **Source**: Application, AWS service, or system
- **Log Stream**: Captures log events for a specific resource
- **Log Group**: Organizes related log streams together

---

## Key Capabilities

### Log Collection

CloudWatch Logs can ingest data from:

- **AWS services**: EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, RDS, VPC, etc.
- **Custom applications**: Using CloudWatch Logs Agent or Fluent Bit
- **On-premises systems**: Through hybrid agent-based setup

### Log Storage and Retention

- Logs are durably stored and encrypted using **KMS**
- Retention can be configured per log group (1 day to indefinite)
- Older logs can be **archived to S3** for long-term storage

---

## CloudWatch Logs Insights

A powerful log analytics engine that lets you:

- Run **ad-hoc queries** using SQL-like syntax
- Aggregate, filter, and visualize log data
- Identify patterns and trends in real time

**Example Query**:

```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 10
```

## Metric Filters

- Create CloudWatch metrics from log patterns
- Useful for tracking custom error rates, API calls, etc.
- Supports alarms and dashboards based on log-derived metrics
- Example: Trigger a CloudWatch alarm if the word "ERROR" appears more than 5 times in a minute.

## Log Subscriptions and Streaming

Use subscription filters to send logs in near real-time to:

- Lambda – For alerting or transformation
- Kinesis Data Streams or Firehose – For analytics pipelines
- Third-party log aggregators – e.g., Splunk, Datadog

## Integration with Other AWS Services

| Service               | Integration Role                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Lambda**            | Automatically logs to CloudWatch Logs  |
| **API Gateway**       | Sends execution/access logs            |
| **CloudTrail**        | Forwards logs to CloudWatch            |
| **VPC Flow Logs**     | Captures IP traffic logs               |
| **CloudWatch Alarms** | Create alerts from log-derived metrics |
| **X-Ray**             | Correlate logs with request traces     |

## Pricing

Billed based on:

- Log data ingestion (per GB)
- Storage (per GB per month)
- Queries (Logs Insights is charged per GB scanned)

## Best Practices

- Use logical naming for log groups and streams
- Set appropriate retention periods per log group
- Use metric filters and alarms to detect issues early
- Enable access control using IAM policies
- Query logs via Logs Insights or export to S3 for Athena

## Summary

Amazon CloudWatch Logs is a scalable, secure, and feature-rich platform for log management and analysis. By organizing logs into log groups and log streams, it provides structured visibility into your system’s behavior. It supports alerting, metric generation, real-time streaming, and interactive querying, making it a central piece of your observability toolkit.

# Amazon CloudWatch Metrics

**Amazon CloudWatch Metrics** are **time-series data** points that represent the performance of your AWS resources, applications, and services. Metrics are central to **monitoring, alerting, and visualizing system health** in AWS.

Each metric consists of:

- A **name**
- A **namespace**
- A set of **dimensions** (metadata, like instance ID or function name)
- A **unit** (e.g., seconds, percent, bytes)
- A **timestamp** and **value**

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Metric Namespace**

- A **logical container** for related metrics
- AWS services use predefined namespaces (e.g., `AWS/EC2`, `AWS/Lambda`)
- Custom metrics use custom namespaces (e.g., `MyApp/Metrics`)

### 2. **Dimensions**

- Key-value pairs that act as **metadata** to identify a metric uniquely
- Example: `InstanceId = i-1234567890abcdef0` for EC2 metrics

### 3. **Statistic Types**

- **Sample Count** – Number of data points
- **Average** – Mean value of data points
- **Sum** – Total of all values
- **Minimum/Maximum** – Lowest or highest value
- **Percentile** – Distribution values (e.g., p90, p99)

---

## Default vs Custom Metrics

### a. **AWS-Generated (Default) Metrics**

- Automatically collected for supported AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda)
- Examples:
  - `CPUUtilization` (EC2)
  - `Invocations` / `Duration` (Lambda)
  - `DatabaseConnections` (RDS)
  - `BucketSizeBytes` (S3)

### b. **Custom Metrics**

- Published using the **CloudWatch PutMetricData API**, **AWS SDK**, or **CLI**
- Used for tracking application-level or business metrics (e.g., `OrdersPlaced`, `Logins`)

**Example (CLI)**:

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
  --namespace "MyApp" \
  --metric-name "ActiveUsers" \
  --value 124 \
  --unit Count
```

## High-Resolution Metrics

- Standard resolution: 1-minute granularity
- High-resolution: 1-second granularity (for more precision)
- Can trigger alarms faster and more accurately

## Metric Granularity and Retention

| Granularity         | Retention Period       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 second (high-res) | 3 hours                |
| 1 minute            | 15 days                |
| 5 minutes           | 63 days                |
| 1 hour              | 455 days (\~15 months) |

## Visualizing Metrics

Use CloudWatch Dashboards to:

- Plot one or more metrics over time

- Compare metrics across dimensions or namespaces

- Set color-coded thresholds for visual clarity

## Using Metrics with Alarms

- Define CloudWatch Alarms on metrics to take automated action
- Example: Alarm if CPUUtilization > 80% for 5 minutes
- Alarm actions: Notify via SNS, Auto Scale, reboot EC2, run Systems Manager scripts

## Metric Math

- Combine multiple metrics into a new time-series
- Perform operations like addition/subtraction, averages, conditional logic (e.g., IF, AND), etc.
- Useful for building composite metrics and insights
- Example:

  ```
  m1 = cpu_utilization_ec2_1
  m2 = cpu_utilization_ec2_2
  average = (m1 + m2) / 2

  ```

## Common CloudWatch Metric Namespaces

| Namespace    | Description                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `AWS/EC2`    | Instance CPU, disk, network, status |
| `AWS/Lambda` | Invocations, errors, duration       |
| `AWS/S3`     | Storage usage, requests             |
| `AWS/RDS`    | DB connections, CPU, disk, IOPS     |
| `AWS/ECS`    | Task count, CPU/memory reservation  |
| `AWS/ELB`    | Request count, latency, HTTP codes  |

## Summary

Amazon CloudWatch Metrics are the foundation of monitoring in AWS. They provide real-time insights into the health and performance of AWS services and custom workloads. With dashboards, alarms, metric math, and analytics, metrics empower you to make data-driven decisions, automate operational responses, and ensure high availability of your applications.
