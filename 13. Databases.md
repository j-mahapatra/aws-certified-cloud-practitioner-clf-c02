# Databases in AWS

AWS provides a wide range of **fully managed and self-managed database services** to meet the needs of different applications—ranging from transactional systems to analytics, from structured relational data to unstructured document or key-value storage.

## Categories of AWS Database Services

### 1. **Relational Databases**

Used for structured data and ACID-compliant transactional workloads.

#### Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

- Fully managed relational database
- Supports engines: **MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora**
- Automates backups, patching, scaling, and high availability

#### Amazon Aurora

- AWS-built relational database compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Up to 5x faster than standard MySQL
- High availability with auto-replication across multiple AZs

### 2. **NoSQL Databases**

Designed for flexible schema, low-latency access, and massive scalability.

#### Amazon DynamoDB

- Serverless key-value and document database
- Single-digit millisecond performance at any scale
- Built-in support for backup, restore, and auto-scaling

#### Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)

- Managed Cassandra-compatible database
- Scalable and highly available with serverless architecture

### 3. **In-Memory Databases**

Used for caching, real-time analytics, and fast lookups.

#### Amazon ElastiCache

- In-memory caching layer for applications
- Supports **Redis** and **Memcached**
- Sub-millisecond latency

#### Amazon MemoryDB for Redis

- Durable, highly available Redis-compatible in-memory database
- Designed for primary data storage and microservices

### 4. **Graph Databases**

Optimized for highly connected data and relationship queries.

#### Amazon Neptune

- Fully managed graph database
- Supports **Property Graph** (Gremlin) and **RDF** (SPARQL)
- Use cases: fraud detection, recommendation engines, knowledge graphs

### 5. **Time Series Databases**

Optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data.

#### Amazon Timestream

- Purpose-built time series database
- Scales to trillions of events per day
- Ideal for IoT, monitoring, and DevOps data

### 6. **Ledger Databases**

Provides immutable, cryptographically verifiable records.

#### Amazon QLDB (Quantum Ledger Database)

- Managed ledger database with built-in journal
- Ensures data integrity and full audit history
- Ideal for systems of record (supply chain, finance, etc.)

### 7. **Data Warehousing**

A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized repository designed to store, integrate, and analyze **large volumes of structured data** from multiple sources. It is optimized for **online analytical processing** (OLAP) rather than **online transactional processing** (OLTP).

#### Amazon Redshift

- Fully managed data warehouse optimized for OLAP queries
- Petabyte-scale storage and fast SQL querying
- Supports integration with S3, Lake Formation, and BI tools

## Self-Managed Databases on EC2

You can also run any database engine manually on **Amazon EC2** instances. This provides full control but requires you to handle:

- Setup and installation
- Backups and scaling
- Security and patching

## Comparison Summary

| Database Type     | Service               | Ideal Use Case                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Relational        | RDS, Aurora           | Traditional apps, transactional workloads |
| NoSQL / Key-Value | DynamoDB, Keyspaces   | High-speed web apps, IoT, gaming          |
| In-Memory         | ElastiCache, MemoryDB | Caching, real-time sessions, leaderboard  |
| Graph             | Neptune               | Recommendation engines, social networks   |
| Time Series       | Timestream            | IoT sensors, application monitoring       |
| Ledger            | QLDB                  | Immutable records, financial systems      |
| Data Warehouse    | Redshift              | BI, reporting, big data analytics         |

## Conclusion

AWS offers a comprehensive portfolio of database services that are **scalable, secure, and purpose-built** for various use cases. Whether you're building transactional applications, real-time analytics, or large-scale reporting systems, AWS has a managed database service to meet your needs.
