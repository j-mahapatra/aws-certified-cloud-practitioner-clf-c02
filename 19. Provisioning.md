By choosing the right tool based on your use case, you can **accelerate delivery, enforce best practices**, and **maintain governance at scale**.

# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** that makes it easy to **deploy, manage, and scale web applications and services**. You simply upload your code, and Beanstalk handles the rest: provisioning infrastructure, load balancing, scaling, monitoring, and patching.

It is designed for developers who want to **focus on code**, not infrastructure.

## Key Features

### 1. **Simplified Deployment**

- Deploy code using AWS Console, CLI, EB CLI, or CI/CD tools
- Supports direct deployment from Git or ZIP files
- Automatically creates all required resources (EC2, ALB, RDS, Auto Scaling, etc.)

### 2. **Multi-Language Support**

- Supports multiple platforms:
  - Node.js
  - Python
  - Java (Tomcat)
  - .NET (IIS)
  - PHP
  - Ruby
  - Go
  - Docker
  - Custom platforms (via Packer scripts)

### 3. **Environment Management**

- Supports **two environment types**:

  - **Web Server Environment**: For apps with HTTP/HTTPS traffic
  - **Worker Environment**: For background processing with SQS

- Create **multiple environments** (dev, test, prod) with environment variables and configurations

### 4. **Built-in High Availability and Scaling**

- Launches your app across multiple Availability Zones (Multi-AZ)
- Supports **Auto Scaling Groups** to scale instances based on CPU or load
- Load balancers (ALB, NLB) automatically included for web environments

### 5. **Monitoring and Logging**

- Integrated with **Amazon CloudWatch**, **AWS X-Ray**, and **Elastic Load Balancing**
- Access logs via the AWS Console or download them to your local machine
- Notifications and health reports through **Amazon SNS**

### 6. **Customization via Configuration Files**

- Use `.ebextensions` (YAML files) to:
  - Install packages
  - Run commands
  - Configure software settings
  - Attach IAM roles or policies

## Architecture Overview

When you deploy an application, Elastic Beanstalk creates:

- **EC2 instances** running your app
- **Security groups**
- **Load balancer** (ALB/NLB)
- **Auto Scaling group**
- **CloudWatch alarms**
- **S3 bucket** for deployment versions
- Optional **RDS instance**

You can **choose to fully manage**, or **customize any part** of this architecture.

## Deployment Options

| Method              | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Instance** | One EC2 instance (useful for dev/test)            |
| **Load Balanced**   | Multiple instances behind a load balancer         |
| **Blue/Green**      | Deploy new version in parallel and switch traffic |
| **Rolling Updates** | Update instances in batches                       |

## Supported Deployment Strategies

- **All at once**: Fastest, but causes downtime
- **Rolling**: Updates a few instances at a time
- **Rolling with additional batch**: Adds temporary capacity to avoid downtime
- **Immutable**: Deploys to new instances before switching over
- **Blue/Green**: Deploy to a separate environment and swap URLs

## Integration with Other AWS Services

| Service          | Purpose                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **RDS**          | Add managed databases to your application          |
| **CloudWatch**   | Monitor metrics and set alarms                     |
| **IAM**          | Secure access and define roles for EC2 or your app |
| **S3**           | Store app versions and log files                   |
| **CodePipeline** | Automate CI/CD deployments                         |

## Benefits

- **No infrastructure to manage**
- **Supports common app stacks**
- **Integrated scaling and monitoring**
- **Fast deployment for full-stack apps**
- **Highly customizable if needed**

## Use Cases

- Rapid deployment of web and API backends
- Deploying containerized applications (via Docker)
- Temporary environments for testing and staging
- MVP and startup projects with minimal DevOps

## Limitations to Consider

- Limited support for **fine-grained networking** (use VPC config for more control)
- Not ideal for **complex multi-service applications**
- May be less flexible than ECS/EKS for microservices

## Summary

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is a developer-friendly PaaS that simplifies deploying and running web applications. It abstracts infrastructure provisioning while still giving you access to underlying resources when needed. It's best suited for **monolithic or containerized apps**, and provides **built-in scaling, monitoring, and health management**, all in a few clicks or commands.
