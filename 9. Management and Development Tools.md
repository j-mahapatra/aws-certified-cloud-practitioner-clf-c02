# AWS API

An AWS API (Application Programming Interface) refers to the set of endpoints and methods that Amazon Web Services exposes to allow developers to programmatically interact with AWS services.

## Types of APIs in AWS

### 1. AWS Service APIs

- These are the native APIs provided by each AWS service (e.g., S3, EC2, Lambda).
- Example:

  s3.putObject() to upload files to S3

  ec2.runInstances() to launch an EC2 instance

### 2. Amazon API Gateway

- A fully managed service to create, publish, secure, monitor, and scale APIs.
- It acts as a gateway for custom REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs that interact with AWS services or backend systems.

## How do AWS APIs work?

When you call an AWS API (via SDK, CLI, or REST), the request typically:

- is signed with your AWS credentials using Signature Version 4.

- sent over HTTPS to a specific endpoint.

- gets processed by the AWS service.

- returns a JSON or XML response.

## Authentication and Security

- AWS APIs are protected with IAM roles and policies

- All requests must be signed with access keys, unless public access is enabled (not recommended)

- API Gateway allows throttling, usage plans, and custom authorizers

## Common Use Cases

- Automating infrastructure with SDKs or CLI (e.g., creating Lambda functions)

- Integrating external applications with AWS via API Gateway

- Building serverless backends using Lambda + API Gateway

- Monitoring services with CloudWatch APIs

# AWS Management Console

The AWS Management Console is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to manage AWS services and resources easily, without needing to use the command line or APIs directly.

# Service Console

A Service Console is the web interface for managing a particular AWS service, such as EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, etc. Each service has its own console with tools, settings, and workflows tailored to that service.

# AWS Account ID

- 12 Digits Id that is unique to each account.
- Can be found under the global profile dropdown.

# AWS Tools for Powershell

- AWS Tools for PowerShell is a set of PowerShell modules that enables you to manage your AWS services and resources directly from the PowerShell command line. It provides a convenient way to script and automate AWS operations on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- AWS Cloudshell is an alternative that AWS provides through its management console in some regions. It is a browser-based shell with some preinstalled tools and a 1GB free persistent storage for each region. It supports multiple shell environments like bash, zsh, and powershell.

- Key Features

  1. PowerShell Cmdlets for AWS:
     Each AWS API operation is available as a PowerShell cmdlet.
     For example:

     - Get-S3Bucket: Lists S3 buckets

     - New-EC2Instance: Launches a new EC2 instance

     - Invoke-LMFunction: Invokes a Lambda function

  2. Cross-Platform Support:
     It works on:

     - Windows PowerShell 5.1
     - PowerShell Core 6+ (Windows, Linux, macOS)

  3. AWS Credential Management
     Supports multiple authentication methods:

     - IAM roles
     - Access keys in environment variables
     - AWS credential/config files
     - AWS SSO

  4. Automation and Scripting:
     You can use PowerShell scripts to automate repetitive tasks, deploy infrastructure, and manage resources just like with the AWS CLI or SDKs.

# Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)

- An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is a unique identifier for an AWS resource. ARNs are used across AWS to reference resources unambiguously in IAM policies, API calls, CLI commands, CloudFormation templates, and more.

- The general format of an ARN is:

  ```
  arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id
  ```

  ```
  arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id
  ```

  ```
  arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource:resource-id
  ```

- e.g. - `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket`, `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-0abcdef1234567890`, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AdminRole`

- ARNs are case-sensitive.
- Some services (like S3) have global scope and do not require a region or account ID in the ARN.
- Wildcards (\*) can be used in ARNs for pattern matching in IAM policies.

# AWS CLI

- The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified command-line tool to manage and automate AWS services. It enables users to interact with AWS APIs from a terminal or shell environment using simple commands.

- It can be used to run commands to:

  - Launch EC2 instances
  - Upload/download files from S3
  - Invoke Lambda functions
  - Manage IAM users and policies
  - Query CloudWatch logs, and much more

- Set up your credentials and default region using the command `aws configure`.

# AWS SDK

- The AWS SDK is a set of language-specific libraries and tools that enable developers to interact with AWS services programmatically using familiar programming languages.

- AWS provides SDKs for many popular languages, including JavaScript/TypeScript (aws-sdk for Node.js and browser), Python (boto3), Java, C# (.NET), Go, Ruby, PHP, C++, etc.

## Why use AWS SDK?

| Feature                   | Benefit                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Native Language Support   | Use AWS services in the same language you're building your app in           |
| Built-in Auth             | Automatically signs requests using IAM credentials                          |
| Higher-Level Abstractions | Some SDKs (like Python's `boto3`) provide resource models for easier access |
| Automatic Retries         | Handles transient errors with exponential backoff                           |
| Pagination Support        | Automatically handles paginated results                                     |

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning cloud infrastructure through code, rather than manual processes. In AWS, IaC enables you to automate the setup, deployment, and management of resources like EC2 instances, VPCs, S3 buckets, and more using configuration files or scripts.

## IaC Tools in AWS

### 1. AWS CloudFormation

- Native AWS IaC service
- Uses YAML or JSON templates
- Manages full resource lifecycle: create, update, delete
- Supports stacks and nested stacks

### 2. AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)

- Define infrastructure using programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, etc.
- Compiles to CloudFormation templates
- Supports object-oriented abstractions and logic

### 3. Terraform (by HashiCorp)

- Popular third-party, cloud-agnostic IaC tool
- Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
- Works with AWS via the AWS provider

## Use Cases

- Deploying full environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Creating repeatable infrastructure blueprints
- Automating disaster recovery setups
- Managing microservices and serverless stacks

## Best Practices

- Store IaC code in Git repositories
- Use modular and reusable templates or stacks
- Review changes before applying (change sets/plans)
- Integrate IaC in CI/CD pipelines
- Use parameterization for environment-specific value
