# Zero Trust Security Model in AWS

## What is the Zero Trust Model?

The **Zero Trust Model** is a security framework based on the principle of **"never trust, always verify"**. Unlike traditional perimeter-based security models that trust entities within the network by default, Zero Trust **assumes that threats exist both outside and inside the network**. Every request—regardless of origin—must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted.

## Core Principles of Zero Trust

1. **Verify explicitly**

   - Authenticate and authorize based on all available data points (identity, device health, location, etc.).

2. **Use least privilege access**

   - Grant only the minimum permissions necessary to complete a task.

3. **Assume breach**
   - Design systems assuming a breach has already occurred.

## Zero Trust in AWS: Implementation Components

AWS does not have a single product called “Zero Trust,” but provides a comprehensive set of services and best practices to implement a Zero Trust architecture.

Choosing between **AWS Managed Microsoft AD**, **AD Connector**, and **Simple AD** depends on your organization’s scale, existing infrastructure, and specific application requirements.

# Identity Provider (IdP)

## Definition

An **Identity Provider (IdP)** is a service or system that **authenticates users** and provides **identity verification** to other systems, often using standards like **SAML**, **OAuth 2.0**, or **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. It allows users to access external applications or services **without managing separate credentials** for each system.

## Functions of an Identity Provider

1. **User Authentication**  
   Verifies user credentials such as username, password, and multi-factor authentication.

2. **Token Issuance**  
   Issues authentication tokens (e.g., SAML assertions, OIDC ID tokens, OAuth access tokens) after verifying identity.

3. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
   Enables users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without logging in again.

4. **Federated Identity**  
   Allows users from different domains or organizations to access services using a trusted relationship between their home IdP and the application.

5. **User Directory Integration**  
   Often maintains user profiles, roles, and groups, or integrates with a directory like Active Directory or LDAP.

## Identity Provider vs Service Provider

In federated authentication:

- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Performs authentication and provides user identity information.
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Relies on the IdP for authentication and authorizes access to its services based on that identity.

## Common Authentication Protocols

- **SAML 2.0**: XML-based protocol for exchanging authentication data, commonly used for enterprise SSO.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Framework for authorization, used widely in APIs and third-party app integrations.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: An authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0, used for verifying user identity.

## Examples of Identity Providers

| Type            | Examples                                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloud IdPs      | AWS IAM Identity Center, Azure AD, Google Workspace               |
| Enterprise IdPs | Okta, Ping Identity, Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) |
| Social IdPs     | Google, Facebook, GitHub, Apple                                   |

## Identity Providers in AWS

AWS supports identity federation using external IdPs:

- **AWS IAM Identity Center** integrates with SAML IdPs like Okta, Azure AD, and AD FS.
- **Amazon Cognito** supports federated login using social IdPs (Google, Facebook, Apple) or SAML-based enterprise IdPs.
- **AWS IAM** supports identity federation via SAML 2.0 for granting temporary access to AWS resources.

## Benefits of Using an IdP

- Centralized authentication and user management
- Single sign-on across cloud, on-premises, and SaaS apps
- Improved security through consistent policies and MFA
- Simplified user provisioning and de-provisioning

## Summary

An Identity Provider is a trusted system responsible for authenticating users and issuing identity credentials that can be used to access external systems or applications. It plays a central role in enabling secure, scalable, and user-friendly access to modern distributed systems.

# Single Sign-On (SSO)

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** is an **authentication process** that allows a user to access **multiple applications or services** with a **single set of login credentials** (username and password). Once the user is authenticated by a central identity provider (IdP), they can access all connected systems without being prompted to log in again for each one.

## How SSO Works

1. The user accesses an application (Service Provider or SP).
2. The application redirects the user to the Identity Provider (IdP).
3. The IdP authenticates the user.
4. Upon successful authentication, the IdP issues a security token (e.g., SAML assertion, OIDC token).
5. The user is redirected back to the application along with the token.
6. The application verifies the token and grants access.
7. The same token (or session) can now be reused for other applications integrated with the same IdP.

## Key Components

- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Authenticates users and issues tokens.
- **Service Provider (SP)**: The application or service that the user wants to access.
- **Authentication Protocols**: SAML, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC) are commonly used to transmit authentication tokens securely.

## Benefits of SSO

- **Improved User Experience**: Users log in once and access all connected systems without repeated logins.
- **Reduced Password Fatigue**: Fewer passwords to remember, lowering the chance of weak password usage.
- **Centralized Access Control**: Easier to enforce security policies from a central location.
- **Faster Onboarding and Offboarding**: Add or remove users across all systems from a single identity source.
- **Better Audit and Compliance**: Central logs of all authentication activities improve visibility and governance.

## Use Cases

- Enterprises managing multiple internal systems (HR, CRM, Finance).
- Educational institutions providing unified access to learning tools.
- SaaS environments using third-party identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace.
- AWS environments using IAM Identity Center or Cognito with integrated applications.

## SSO in AWS

- **IAM Identity Center**: Enables centralized SSO to AWS accounts and applications using SAML.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Provides SSO for web/mobile apps with federated login using social or enterprise IdPs.
- **SAML Federation**: Allows users from a SAML-compliant IdP to access AWS resources via temporary credentials.

## Summary

Single Sign-On (SSO) simplifies and secures the user authentication process by allowing users to access multiple applications using one set of credentials. It improves user productivity, reduces administrative overhead, and centralizes security controls across enterprise environments.

# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is an **open, vendor-neutral application protocol** used to **access and manage directory services** over a network. A directory in this context is a specialized database optimized for **read-heavy access patterns** and **hierarchical data**, often used for storing **user identities**, **credentials**, **groups**, **permissions**, and other organizational resources.

## Purpose of LDAP

LDAP is widely used for:

- **User authentication and authorization**
- **Centralized identity management**
- **Managing organizational hierarchies**
- **Querying directory information (e.g., names, email addresses, phone numbers)**

## How LDAP Works

1. A client (e.g., an application or service) sends a **bind request** to the LDAP server to authenticate.
2. Once authenticated, the client performs **operations** such as searching, adding, modifying, or deleting entries.
3. LDAP uses a **tree-based data structure** (similar to a file system) called the **Directory Information Tree (DIT)**.

## Directory Structure

The data in an LDAP directory is organized in a **hierarchical format**, with entries identified using a **Distinguished Name (DN)**.

Example:

`dn: cn=John Doe,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`

- `cn`: Common Name (e.g., user's full name)
- `ou`: Organizational Unit (e.g., department)
- `dc`: Domain Component (e.g., part of domain name)

## LDAP Operations

Common LDAP operations include:

- **Bind**: Authenticate to the LDAP server
- **Search**: Look up entries based on filters
- **Compare**: Check if an entry has a specific attribute value
- **Add**: Insert a new entry
- **Modify**: Update an existing entry
- **Delete**: Remove an entry

## Protocol

- Operates over **TCP/IP**, typically on port **389** for unencrypted and **636** for LDAPS (LDAP over SSL).
- Can be integrated with **TLS/SSL** for secure communication.
- Supports **SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)** for flexible authentication mechanisms.

## Use Cases

- Authentication for internal systems (e.g., Linux login via LDAP)
- Backend identity store for enterprise applications
- Directory service for email systems, intranet portals, and HR platforms
- Federation with Single Sign-On (SSO) platforms

## LDAP vs Active Directory

| Feature          | LDAP                    | Microsoft Active Directory           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Protocol         | LDAP                    | LDAP + Kerberos + proprietary RPC    |
| Platform         | Open standard           | Microsoft-specific                   |
| Authentication   | Simple or SASL          | Kerberos, NTLM                       |
| Functionality    | Directory service only  | Directory + GPOs + device management |
| Typical Use Case | Unix/Linux environments | Windows enterprise environments      |

## LDAP in AWS

AWS does not host a native LDAP server but supports it via:

- **AWS Directory Service (Simple AD)**: A Samba-based, LDAP-compatible directory.
- **AWS Managed Microsoft AD**: Fully managed Active Directory (LDAP-compatible).
- **Amazon Cognito**: Can federate with LDAP through SAML IdPs.

## Summary

LDAP is a protocol for accessing and managing distributed directory information in a network. It is widely used in identity and access management systems to authenticate users and manage organizational hierarchies. Its lightweight nature and support for structured, read-optimized queries make it a foundational technology in enterprise IT environments.

# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is a security mechanism that requires a user to provide **two or more independent credentials** (factors) to verify their identity before granting access to a system or application. The goal of MFA is to **add additional layers of protection** beyond just a username and password.

## The Three Authentication Factors

1. **Something you know**  
   Examples: Password, PIN, answers to security questions.

2. **Something you have**  
   Examples: Smartphone, hardware token, smart card, authenticator app.

3. **Something you are**  
   Examples: Fingerprint, facial recognition, retina scan (biometrics).

MFA combines at least **two** of these factors. If only one factor is used (e.g., password), it is **single-factor authentication**.

## How MFA Works

1. User enters their username and password (first factor).
2. System prompts for a second factor, such as a one-time code from an authenticator app or SMS.
3. If both factors are correct, access is granted.

## Types of MFA Methods

| MFA Type                 | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| SMS-based Codes          | One-time passcodes sent via SMS                            |
| Email-based Codes        | OTPs delivered via email (less secure than SMS)            |
| TOTP Apps                | Time-based One-Time Passwords (e.g., Google Authenticator) |
| Push Notification        | App sends approval request to mobile device                |
| Hardware Tokens          | Physical devices generating OTPs (e.g., YubiKey)           |
| Biometric Authentication | Uses fingerprint, face, or retina                          |

## Benefits of MFA

- **Increased security**: Prevents unauthorized access even if a password is compromised.
- **Protects against phishing and credential stuffing attacks**
- **Compliance**: Required by many standards (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR).
- **Low cost, high impact**: Easy to implement and provides strong security benefits.

## MFA in AWS

AWS supports MFA in several ways:

- **IAM Console Access**: Enable MFA for IAM users using virtual or hardware devices.
- **Root User MFA**: Strongly recommended to secure the root account with MFA.
- **AWS CLI/API MFA**: MFA can be required for CLI or programmatic access using session tokens.
- **IAM Identity Center (SSO)**: Integrates with SAML IdPs that support MFA.

## MFA Device Types Supported by AWS

| Device Type       | Examples                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Virtual MFA       | Google Authenticator, Authy |
| U2F Devices       | YubiKey, Titan Security Key |
| SMS MFA (via IdP) | Third-party IdPs like Okta  |

## Best Practices

- Enforce MFA for all administrative and privileged accounts.
- Use **hardware or app-based** MFA rather than SMS (less secure).
- Combine MFA with **least privilege** policies and **logging** for full access control.
- Periodically audit and rotate MFA devices.

## Summary

Multi-Factor Authentication is a vital security practice that enhances user identity verification by requiring multiple independent credentials. By combining something the user knows, has, or is, MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and strengthens the overall security posture of systems and applications.

# Security Keys

**Security keys** are **physical hardware devices** used as a second factor in multi-factor authentication (MFA). They are based on **public key cryptography** and provide strong, phishing-resistant authentication by requiring **possession of the device** to complete the login process.

## Purpose

Security keys help protect against:

- Credential phishing
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Session hijacking

They are especially useful for securing access to sensitive systems such as cloud accounts, administrative consoles, and critical infrastructure.

## How Security Keys Work

1. The user enters their username and password.
2. The application prompts for a second factor.
3. The user plugs in or taps the security key.
4. The key signs a cryptographic challenge using a private key stored in the device.
5. The server verifies the response using a corresponding public key.

This process uses **asymmetric encryption**, and the private key never leaves the device.

## Supported Protocols

| Protocol     | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **U2F**      | Universal 2nd Factor, developed by FIDO Alliance and Google.                                     |
| **FIDO2**    | Modern standard combining WebAuthn and CTAP for passwordless and MFA.                            |
| **WebAuthn** | Web standard enabling secure authentication using public key cryptography.                       |
| **CTAP**     | Client to Authenticator Protocol, enables USB, NFC, Bluetooth communication with authenticators. |

## Types of Security Keys

| Form Factor | Interface      | Example Devices          |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| USB-A       | USB            | YubiKey 5, NitroKey      |
| USB-C       | USB            | YubiKey 5C, SoloKeys     |
| NFC         | Wireless (Tap) | YubiKey NEO, Feitian     |
| Bluetooth   | Wireless       | Titan Security Key (BLE) |

## Security Benefits

- **Phishing Resistance**: Keys are bound to specific domains, preventing credential reuse.
- **No shared secrets**: Unlike passwords or OTPs, nothing reusable is stored on the server.
- **Local user presence verification**: Requires touch or button press to operate.
- **Tamper-resistant**: Keys are designed to be hard to clone or extract private keys from.

## Use Cases

- Securing access to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Protecting root/admin accounts
- Developer Git commit signing
- Passwordless login
- Compliance-heavy environments (e.g., finance, healthcare)

## Security Keys in AWS

- **AWS IAM** supports U2F and FIDO2-compliant keys for MFA on the AWS Management Console.
- Keys must be registered per user via the AWS Security Credentials section.
- Programmatic access (CLI, SDKs) does not yet support security keys directly, but MFA tokens can be generated from keys via identity providers.

## Best Practices

- Use **security keys for all privileged accounts**, including root.
- Register **at least two keys** per account to avoid lockouts.
- Store backup keys in a secure location.
- Prefer **FIDO2/WebAuthn** devices for future-proof authentication.

## Summary

Security keys are physical devices that provide cryptographically secure, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. They are an essential tool in modern identity security, offering higher assurance than SMS, email, or app-based MFA solutions. Their adoption is strongly recommended for administrators, developers, and users with access to sensitive systems.

# Anatomy of an IAM Policy in AWS

## What is an IAM Policy?

An **IAM policy** in AWS is a **JSON document** that defines **permissions**. It specifies which **actions** are allowed or denied, on which **resources**, and under what **conditions**, for a **user, group, or role**.

IAM policies control access to AWS services and resources. They are attached to **IAM identities** (users, groups, roles) or AWS resources (like S3 buckets or Lambda functions).

## Structure of an IAM Policy

An IAM policy document has the following key elements:

### 1. `Version`

Specifies the policy language version. Always use:

```
"Version": "2012-10-17"
```

### 2. `Statement`

An array (or single object) that defines the actual permission rules.

Each statement includes the following fields:

| Field       | Required | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Effect`    | Yes      | Can be `Allow` or `Deny`. Deny always overrides Allow.           |
| `Action`    | Yes      | Specifies the AWS service actions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`).        |
| `Resource`  | Yes      | Specifies the AWS resource(s) affected (ARN format).             |
| `Condition` | No       | Optional. Adds conditional logic using key-value pairs.          |
| `Principal` | No       | Required in resource-based policies to define who it applies to. |

## Example IAM Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy allows `s3:GetObject` permission for all objects in `my-bucket`.

## Detailed Breakdown of Fields

- **Effect**

  - Allow: Grants access.
  - Deny: Explicitly denies access. Always takes precedence.

- **Action**

  - Defines one or more AWS actions (API operations).
  - **Examples:**
    - s3:ListBucket
    - ec2:StartInstances
    - dynamodb:PutItem
    - (wildcard for all actions)

- **Resource**

  - Specifies the AWS resources to which the action applies, using Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
  - **Examples:**
    - arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket
    - arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0

- **Condition**

  - Adds logic that further constrains when the policy is in effect.
  - **Example:**

        ```
        "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": { "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24" }
        }
        ```

- **Principal**

  - Used only in resource-based policies to specify who the policy applies to.

  - **Example:**
    ```
    "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
    }
    ```

## Types of IAM Policies

| Type                     | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity-based policy    | Attached to IAM users, groups, or roles                         |
| Resource-based policy    | Attached directly to AWS resources (e.g., S3, Lambda, SNS)      |
| Permission boundaries    | Define maximum permissions a user or role can have              |
| Session policies         | Temporary permissions passed in AWS STS assume-role calls       |
| Service control policies | Used in AWS Organizations to manage permissions across accounts |

## IAM Policy Evaluation Logic

- By default, all requests are denied.

- An Allow policy grants access if it matches.

- Any matching Deny policy explicitly blocks access, even if Allow is present.

## Summary

An IAM policy is a structured JSON document that controls access to AWS services. It includes fields like Effect, Action, Resource, and optional Condition or Principal. Understanding IAM policy structure and evaluation logic is essential for secure AWS operations.

# Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

- The **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** is a foundational security concept that states:

  A user, system, or process should be granted **only the minimum access rights and permissions** necessary to perform its intended function.

- This means **limiting access** to resources, data, and operations so that entities cannot do more than what is absolutely required.

## Why It Matters

Applying least privilege:

- **Reduces attack surface**: Fewer permissions mean fewer opportunities for misuse.
- **Limits damage**: Compromised accounts or processes can only affect a small portion of the system.
- **Improves auditing and accountability**: Fewer permissions make it easier to detect anomalies.
- **Helps with compliance**: Many standards (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001) require enforcement of least privilege.

## Real-World Examples

- A developer only needs read access to production logs, not the ability to deploy code.
- An EC2 instance only needs access to a specific S3 bucket, not all buckets in the account.
- A Lambda function is given write access only to the DynamoDB table it interacts with.

## Least Privilege in AWS

AWS supports the principle of least privilege through **fine-grained access controls** using IAM policies, roles, and conditions.

### How to Apply PoLP in AWS

1. **Start with no permissions**  
   Grant access incrementally as required.

2. **Use IAM Roles and Policies**  
   Assign permissions based on roles rather than individuals.

3. **Define specific actions and resources**  
   Avoid using wildcards like `*` unless absolutely necessary.

4. **Use conditions**  
   Add constraints like time of access, IP range, or MFA requirement.

5. **Regularly review permissions**  
   Audit IAM roles and policies for unused or excessive permissions.

6. **Use permissions boundaries and SCPs**  
   Define maximum allowable permissions for users or roles.

### Example IAM Policy (Good Practice)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::project-data-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy grants only read access to a specific S3 bucket, not all S3 operations or resources.

## Common Pitfalls

- Granting broad access (e.g., s3:_ or ec2:_) for convenience.
- Reusing administrator roles for day-to-day tasks.
- Failing to audit or clean up stale users, roles, or permissions.

## Summary

The Principle of Least Privilege is a core security best practice that restricts access rights to the bare minimum required. In AWS and other systems, enforcing this principle reduces risk, improves governance, and strengthens overall security posture. Always assign access deliberately and minimally, review it regularly, and remove unnecessary permissions as early as possible.

# AWS Account Root User

The **AWS account root user** is the **original identity** created when an AWS account is first established. It is associated with the **email address and password** used to create the account and has **unrestricted access** to **all resources and services** in that AWS account.

The root user is **not an IAM user**. It is the **account-level owner** with **permanent full administrative privileges**, and its actions cannot be restricted using IAM policies, SCPs, or permission boundaries.

## Capabilities of the Root User

The root user can perform **all actions**, including those that **cannot be delegated** to IAM users or roles. These include:

- Changing the AWS account root credentials (email/password)
- Changing or closing the AWS account
- Restoring IAM user permissions
- Managing AWS Support plans
- Modifying payment methods and viewing billing
- Enabling or disabling services like IAM Identity Center
- Generating and managing account access keys for the root user (not recommended)

## Security Risks

Because the root user has **unlimited power**, it is a prime target for attackers. Compromising the root user can lead to **total account takeover**.

Common risks include:

- Misuse due to lack of logging restrictions
- Human error during sensitive operations
- Phishing attacks targeting root credentials

## Best Practices

To secure your AWS account, follow these best practices for managing the root user:

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   Protect the root user with a hardware or virtual MFA device.

2. **Do Not Use Root for Daily Operations**  
   Use IAM users or roles with limited privileges for regular tasks.

3. **Create an Admin IAM User**  
   Immediately create an IAM user or role with administrative access and use it instead of root.

4. **Safeguard Root Credentials**  
   Do not share or expose the root email, password, or access keys.

5. **Use Root Only for Specific Tasks**  
   Only log in as root when absolutely necessary, such as for account setup or billing changes.

6. **Audit Root Usage**  
   Monitor CloudTrail for root user activity and set up alerts on usage.

## Detecting Root User Usage

You can configure **AWS CloudTrail** and **AWS CloudWatch** to detect and alert on root user actions.

Example condition:

```json
{
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "Root"
  }
}
```

## Summary

The AWS account root user is the most powerful identity in your AWS account. It should be protected with MFA, used sparingly, and never shared or exposed. To ensure a secure AWS environment, operational access should always be handled through IAM roles and users with least privilege permissions.
