# Amazon Leadership Principles

Amazon's Leadership Principles are core values that define Amazon’s culture and approach to leadership, hiring, and decision-making. These 16 principles are used to evaluate everything from employee performance to strategic direction.

## 1. Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work to earn and keep customer trust.

- Focus on customer needs, not competitors.
- Make customer satisfaction the top priority.

## 2. Ownership

Leaders act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their team. They think long term.

- Take responsibility for outcomes.
- Never say “that’s not my job.”

## 3. Invent and Simplify

Leaders seek out new solutions and reduce complexity.

- Innovation is expected.
- Look for ways to simplify processes and systems.

## 4. Are Right, A Lot

Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

- Make well-informed decisions.
- Be open to being proven wrong.

## 5. Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.

- Explore new possibilities.
- Encourage experimentation and self-growth.

## 6. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders hire and mentor the best people. They help others improve.

# General Design Principles

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is built on a foundation of **general design principles** that apply across all workloads, regardless of use case or industry. These principles guide cloud architects in building systems that are resilient, secure, high-performing, and cost-effective.

## 1. Stop Guessing Your Capacity Needs

- Traditionally, you provision hardware based on guesswork or peak usage.
- In the cloud, you can **scale resources up or down** dynamically based on actual demand.
- Use **Auto Scaling** and **on-demand provisioning** to avoid overprovisioning and reduce costs.

## 2. Test Systems at Production Scale

- The cloud enables **testing under realistic traffic loads**, data volumes, and failure scenarios.
- Perform load testing, chaos engineering, and failover tests safely and repeatedly.
- Helps uncover issues early and ensure systems behave as expected at scale.

## 3. Automate to Make Architectural Experimentation Easier

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., CloudFormation, CDK) allow you to **build, tear down, and modify environments automatically**.
- Encourages **rapid experimentation** and innovation without manual effort or configuration drift.

## 4. Allow for Evolution of Architecture

- Don’t design for the far future from day one.
- Design systems to **evolve over time** with changing requirements, technologies, and user demands.
- Use **modular, loosely coupled components** so you can swap or upgrade parts independently.

## 5. Drive Architectures Using Data

- Use **metrics, logs, traces**, and other telemetry to guide decisions.
- Measure and analyze everything: performance, cost, user behavior, errors.
- Implement **continuous feedback loops** using tools like Amazon CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Cost Explorer.

## 6. Improve Through Game Days

- Run **Game Days** — controlled, simulated failures or load tests in a production-like environment.
- Validate resilience, incident response, and team preparedness.
- Learn and improve before a real outage happens.

## Summary Table

| Principle                     | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stop guessing capacity        | Use autoscaling to match demand instead of overprovisioning   |
| Test at production scale      | Simulate real-world conditions and failures                   |
| Automate for experimentation  | Use IaC to test and evolve architectures quickly and safely   |
| Allow architectural evolution | Design for change with modular and loosely coupled components |
| Drive with data               | Make decisions based on telemetry, not assumptions            |
| Use Game Days                 | Simulate outages to test resilience and response readiness    |

# Pillar-Specific Design Principles

Each of the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework is supported by a set of **design principles** that guide how you should architect cloud-native applications and workloads. These principles help ensure systems are secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable.

## 1. Operational Excellence

### Design Principles:

- **Perform operations as code**  
  Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate operations and reduce human error.

- **Annotate documentation**  
  Make documentation dynamic and update it with every change or deployment.

- **Make frequent, small, reversible changes**  
  Reduce risk and improve agility by implementing changes incrementally.

- **Refine operations procedures frequently**  
  Continuously improve and evolve operational practices through iteration and feedback.

- **Anticipate failure**  
  Design systems assuming things will go wrong. Build in observability and alerts.

- **Learn from all operational failures**  
  Conduct post-mortems and apply lessons learned to future designs.

## 2. Security

### Design Principles:

- **Implement a strong identity foundation**  
  Use least-privilege access, enforce MFA, and separate duties via roles.

- **Enable traceability**  
  Monitor and log all actions, with automated alerting and auditing.

- **Apply security at all layers**  
  Use defense-in-depth across VPCs, subnets, endpoints, applications, and data.

- **Automate security best practices**  
  Use tools like AWS Config, GuardDuty, and Security Hub to automate checks.

- **Protect data in transit and at rest**  
  Encrypt everything by default using AWS KMS and TLS.

- **Prepare for security events**  
  Have incident response plans, playbooks, and testing procedures in place.

## 3. Reliability

### Design Principles:

- **Automatically recover from failure**  
  Use self-healing mechanisms like auto scaling, health checks, and retries.

- **Test recovery procedures**  
  Regularly simulate and practice disaster recovery and failovers.

- **Scale horizontally to increase availability**  
  Distribute load across multiple smaller resources instead of large single ones.

- **Stop guessing capacity**  
  Use auto scaling and monitoring to adjust resources dynamically.

- **Manage change in automation**  
  Use version-controlled, automated deployments and updates to reduce risk.

## 4. Performance Efficiency

### Design Principles:

- **Democratize advanced technologies**  
  Use managed services (e.g., ML, analytics) to avoid building from scratch.

- **Go global in minutes**  
  Deploy to multiple AWS Regions to reduce latency and serve global users.

- **Use serverless architectures**  
  Offload undifferentiated heavy lifting with Lambda, Fargate, DynamoDB, etc.

- **Experiment more often**  
  Quickly spin up and down environments to test different approaches.

- **Use mechanical sympathy**  
  Match resources to workload needs (e.g., memory-optimized instances for in-memory DBs).

## 5. Cost Optimization

### Design Principles:

- **Adopt a consumption model**  
  Pay only for what you use. Turn off idle resources.

- **Measure overall efficiency**  
  Use CloudWatch and Cost Explorer to track usage and optimize ROI.

- **Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting**  
  Use managed services instead of hosting your own infrastructure.

- **Analyze and attribute expenditure**  
  Use tags and cost allocation reports to identify and assign costs properly.

- **Use managed and spot instances**  
  Take advantage of Spot, Reserved, and Savings Plans to reduce costs.

## 6. Sustainability

### Design Principles:

- **Understand your impact**  
  Use tools like the AWS Sustainability Dashboard to measure carbon footprint.

- **Establish sustainability goals**  
  Set KPIs related to energy usage, emissions, and waste reduction.

- **Maximize resource utilization**  
  Right-size resources, use auto scaling, and decommission unused instances.

- **Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient technologies**  
  Use energy-efficient services (e.g., AWS Graviton, serverless options).

- **Use managed services**  
  Managed services often run more efficiently than user-managed infrastructure.

- **Reduce downstream impact**  
  Design applications that are efficient for your users (e.g., faster page loads).
